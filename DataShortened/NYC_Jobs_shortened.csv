BLDG.,"Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.   As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises â?? from New York Cityâ??s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic â?? we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.   Our Agencyâ??s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a â??response-readyâ? organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâ??s health  5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change   Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racismâ??s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis.

Field Ops,"Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.    As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises â?? from New York Cityâ??s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic â?? we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.    Our Agencyâ??s five strategic priorities, building off a recently completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:   1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a â??response-readyâ? organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâ??s health  5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change    Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racismâ??s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.  The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH)â??s Office of Emergency Preparedness and Response (OEPR) was created to promote DOHMHâ??s and NYCâ??s ability to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from health emergencies. OEPR is responsible for coordinating agency-wide emergency preparedness planning, exercises and training, evaluation of incident response and exercise performance as well as coordinating with community stakeholders, city, state, and federal partners. OEPR envisions a healthy, resilient city in which all New Yorkers are able to achieve and maintain optimal and equitable health outcomes before, during, and after emergencies. OEPRâ??s work recognizes the social inequities that can negatively impact our efforts to  maintain and improve the health of New Yorkers during and after a disaster. OEPR works to improve its application of a social justice and racial equity lens to its emergency preparedness and response work to ensure the most equitable post-disaster public health outcomes possible.

We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.   Our Agencyâ??s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a â??response-readyâ? organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâ??s health  5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change   Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health.

BLDG.,"Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.   As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises â?? from New York Cityâ??s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic â?? we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.   Our Agencyâ??s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a â??response-readyâ? organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâ??s health  5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change   Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racismâ??s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.  PROGRAM AND JOB DESCRIPTION:  The Center for Health Equity & Community Wellness (CHECW) aims to eliminate racial inequities resulting in premature mortality, with a focus on chronic disease, by addressing the social and environmental factors that impact health. CHECW works to increase placed-based investments in priority neighborhoods with community programming and services based on epidemiology; influence and leverage the health system to promote whole-person care; intensify the agency's approach to tackling big salt, sugar, and tobacco; and finding innovative ways to improve the built environment and address other social determinants of health.   CHECW is comprised of the Bureau of Brooklyn Neighborhood Health, the Bureau of Bronx Neighborhood Health, the Bureau of Harlem Neighborhood Health, the Bureau of Chronic Disease Prevention, the Bureau of Health Equity Capacity Building, the Bureau of Equitable Health Systems and the Bureau of Finance, Administration, and Services.   Shop Healthy NYC is a New York City Health Department initiative that aims to increase access to healthy food and engage residents and organizations to support sustainable food retail changes in their community. The program grew out of years of intensive work with more than 1,000 retailers in neighborhoods with the city's worst health outcomes and targets multiple types of food retailers. To ensure a long-term impact on food access, Shop Healthy NYC aims to influence supply and demand by: 1) reaching out to food retailers to increase stock and promotion of healthy foods, including intensively working with stores to meet specific criteria; 2) collaborating with distributors and suppliers to facilitate wholesale purchases and widespread promotion of healthy foods; and 3) engaging community constituents (customers) to support participating retailers and increase neighborhood access to healthy foods.

Our mission is two-fold:  Juvenile Justice and Interstate and International Child Support.   This position is specifically for the Juvenile Justice practice.  When addressing cases of youth charged with criminal acts,  the law requires a rehabilitative determination of the outcome that best meets the needs of the youth and the protection of the community. Family Court Division staff work under the fastest timelines and with complex situations to achieve that goal.    The position offers the opportunity to join approximately 250 people in dedicated service to the children, families and communities of NYC.  We are a citywide Division with locations in all five boroughs.  We investigate cases involving criminal allegations that range from minor offenses often emanating from conflict within families which are immediately met by dedicated case support teams geared to assist; to complicated cases of youth involved with assaults, robberies, weapons possession, arson, attempted homicide and homicide and sexual offenses handled by specially-trained personnel.  Assistants are given the opportunity to train for and join the Divisionâ??s Special Victims Unit which handles complex litigation around sex offenses and other related cases and whose members are nationally trained and certified in forensic interviewing and other specialized skills; and/or the Divisionâ??s Major Case Unit which handles advanced litigation dealing with the most serious charges and challenging needs and whose members work closely with federal, state and local law enforcement to address safety concerns within communities; and the opportunity to qualify to be cross-designated special ADAs in most of the NYC District Attorney offices where they work alongside ADAs on Adolescent Offender cases being removed to Family Court under the historic Raise the Age legislation.   Attorneys  carry  their own caseload and work collaboratively with others in a team approach to cases; and can second chair the most complex cases handled by senior attorneys.  The responsibilities include but are not limited to: interviewing victims, civilian witnesses and police officers; working with law enforcement to obtain, evaluate and analyze evidence to determine the viability of a case thereby determining whether the case can be filed or must be declined. If the case can be filed in court, deciding whether a community based diversion is appropriate; if the case is filed, drafting depositions; filing petitions conducting and providing discovery including body worn camera, DNA, video and Giglio evidence; preparing and conducting pre-trial hearings including pre-petition detention and probable cause hearings, which determine the custodial status of the youth; constitutional suppression hearings to determine the admissibility of evidence; fact-finding hearings (similar to trials in adult criminal cases), which determine whether the juvenile committed the acts alleged; and dispositional (sentencing) hearings.  The Assistant is supported by legal supervisors and legal support professionals.  Case assignment is centered around a vertical prosecution model.     The Family Court Division is ideal for attorneys with a passion for juvenile justice, and  helping communities thrive.  Suitable members of the Division possess the ability to investigate cases, analyze and then advocate for appropriate outcomes on a case-by-case basis, and to expertly  conduct hearings and trials in a fast-paced environment with the ultimate goals of rehabilitation of the youth and the enhancement of the safety of the community.

The office location of the Assistant will be flexible depending on factors such as space availability, preference of the individual and the needs of the Division.  â?¢	The ACC will be welcomed and may be required to attend various inter-agency and borough meetings; and to prepare and present trainings both within the Family Court Division and to other agencies and stakeholders. â?¢	Excellent legal research and writing skills are essential to the position; and participation in special projects such as those addressing legislative, policy and operational change will be offered and may be required. Attorneys are expected to visit crime scenes and conduct interviews  and other casework after hours and on weekends when necessary. â?¢	Our work is ongoing and constant, it affects peoplesâ?? lives.

Program and Job Description:  The Bureau of Mental Healthâ??s mission is to improve mental health and wellness for people in New York City, and to eliminate racial and other long-standing societal disparities by providing services, resources, and opportunities to providers that are grounded in accurate, data driven information that fosters community participation, thus reducing the stigma around mental health.  This includes procuring and monitoring more than 500 contracted programs that provide mental health treatment, psychiatric rehabilitation, supportive housing, care coordination and advocacy services and operating court-mandated Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT), Single Point of Access (SPOA) for mobile treatment and care coordination and NYC Supportive Treatment and Recovery Team (NYCSTART) for people with first episode psychosis.   The Office of Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) is responsible for the management and oversight of the Assisted Outpatient Treatment Program in New York City. The New York State Legislature passed Kendraâ??s law as an amendment to the Mental Hygiene Law to allow for outpatient civil commitment of individuals with histories of serious mental illness, difficulty engaging in rehabilitation, and who present high risk to themselves or the community.

We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.   Our Agencyâ??s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a â??response-readyâ? organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâ??s health  5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change   Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racismâ??s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.  PROGRAM AND JOB DESCRIPTION: The Bureau of Mental Healthâ??s mission is to improve mental health and wellness for people in New York City, and to eliminate racial and other long-standing societal disparities by providing services, resources, and opportunities to providers that are grounded in accurate, data driven information that fosters community participation, thus reducing the stigma around mental health.  This includes procuring and monitoring more than 500 contracted programs that provide mental health treatment, psychiatric rehabilitation, supportive housing, care coordination and advocacy services and operating court-mandated Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT), Single Point of Access (SPOA) for mobile treatment and care coordination and NYC Supportive Treatment And Recovery Team (NYCSTART) for people with first episode psychosis.   The Office of Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) is responsible for the management and oversight of the Assisted Outpatient Treatment Program in New York City. The New York State Legislature passed Kendraâ??s law as an amendment to the Mental Hygiene Law to allow for outpatient civil commitment of individuals with histories of serious mental illness, difficulty engaging in rehabilitation, and who present high risk to themselves or the community. The program enables these individuals to live safely in the community, avoid repeated inpatient hospitalizations, and ensure they have access to comprehensive outpatient services.  Working closely with mental health providers and staff from the Office of Assisted Outpatient Treatment, you will:  -	  Monitor consumer adherence to court order    and treatment plan.  -	Monitor weekly contact with Care Coordinator (CC)/Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) to ensure that all service providers are fulfilling their required responsibilities.  -	Verify consumer services monthly by completing the monthly service verification.  -	Ensure that treatment plans are complete timely.  -	Document any changes to the treatment plan as needed and in consultation with AOT psychiatrists during the order.  -	Monitor, follow-up, and document significant events timely and according to the policy and procedure guidelines.  -	Participate in case conferences to discuss consumer eligibility for AOT as well as progress under the court order.  -	Maintain consumer electronic and hard cover record.  -	Collaborate with other treatment/service providers and/or hospitals regarding current consumers.   **IMPORTANT NOTES TO ALL CANDIDATES:  Please note: If you are called for an interview you will be required to bring to your interview copies of original documentation, such as: â?¢ A document that establishes identity for employment eligibility, such as: A Valid U.S. Passport, Permanent Resident Card/Green Card, or Driverâ??s license.   â?¢ Proof of Education according to the education requirements of the civil service title.   â?¢ Current Resume   â?¢ Proof of Address/NYC Residency dated within the last 60 days, such as: Recent Utility Bill (i.e. Telephone, Cable, Mobile Phone)   Additional documentation may be required to evaluate your qualification as outlined in this postingâ??s â??Minimum Qualification Requirementsâ? section.

Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.   As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises â?? from New York Cityâ??s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic â?? we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services.

Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.   As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises â?? from New York Cityâ??s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic â?? we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.   Our Agencyâ??s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a â??response-readyâ? organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâ??s health  5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change   Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health.

Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic inequities create disparate outcomes in certain neighborhoods as compared with the rest of the city, and providing services beginning in the prenatal through postpartum period is vital to improving these outcomes.

DOHMH's New Family Home Visits (NFHV) Initiative will serve families from pregnancy through the postpartum period. A subset of families will also be offered labor and delivery support by a certified doula.

Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.   As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises â?? from New York Cityâ??s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic â?? we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.   Our Agencyâ??s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a â??response-readyâ? organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâ??s health  5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change   Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racismâ??s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.  PROGRAM AND JOB DESCRIPTION:  The Division of Center for Health Equity & Community Wellness (CHECW) uses a racial and social justice approach to eliminate health inequities for those who are most marginalized in New York City and to reduce overall premature mortality from the leading causes of preventable death with the vision that every New Yorker will live in a thriving neighborhood with equitable access to resources that help support healthy individuals and communities.  This division unifies and strengthens the Department's line of work directed at eliminating racial inequities for preventable health conditions, which are rooted in historical and contemporary injustices and discrimination, including racism.  CHECW's aim is to eliminate racial iniquities resulting in premature mortality, with a focus on chronic disease, by addressing the social and environmental factors that impact health. The goal of this renewed approach is to increase placed-based investment in priority neighborhoods with community programming and services based on epidemiology, influence and leverage the health system to promote whole person care; and intensify the agency's approach to tackle big salt and sugar, big tobacco, the built environment and other determinants of health.   The Bureau of Harlem Neighborhood Health (Harlem BNH) supports the agency's mission to protect and promote the health of all New Yorkers. Harlem BNH focuses on the structural and root causes of health disparity outcomes and develops programs to address these outcomes with input from partners and residents.  Addressing the social determinants of health (SDOH), is a key focus point and is enshrined in programs such as the Harlem Health Advocacy Partnership and the Asthma Counselor Program.  Other Bureau offerings include a variety of programs and activities focused on the health and wellness of Harlem residents.  The Harlem Bureau also houses the East and Central Harlem Neighborhood Health Action Center, which is a key part of the NYC's effort to promote health equity and reduce health disparities in the neighborhood.
