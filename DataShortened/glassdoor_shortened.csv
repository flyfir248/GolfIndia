AFH-Wealth-Management,2017-06-27, Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,5,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5.0,4.0,v,o,v,Great place to work,"- I was made to feel very welcome when I first started and I was never made to feel like I was a 'burden' or an 'inconvenience' to train. I work in admin and although I have 8 years previous experience working within an admin based role prior to starting work at AFH, I had never worked within the finance industry - so there has been a lot to learn, but I have enjoyed learning something new every day!
- Management enable new recruits to learn at their own pace and facilitate their own style of learning when training up new people for their role. AFH provide ongoing product knowledge refresher training, So, if something doesn't 'click' the first time around, you may well understand it much better after having some hands on experience in your new role & sitting in the refresher training session again.
- Knowing that through my work I'm able to assist other people, whether that's clients, co-workers, the advisers, supervisors or management; providing information needed and answering questions - to me that is the one of the biggest pros, job satisfaction.
- Knowing that management trust me to use my own initiative to create & implement new strategies whilst working on large projects.
- There are great possibilities of advancing your career and moving within the business.
- Management acknowledging your efforts and going out of their way to thank you when you have worked hard.
- Treated with respect and kindness & feel valued as an employee. 
- Fast-paced environment, never a dull moment and the time at work flies by!
- Great benefits package.
- Supportive and friendly co-workers.
- Lovely office building to work in.
- The list of pros could go on & on... but I'd be here all day. I love my job and the company.","- Occasionally (as there is in all jobs) there are challenges or situations that can be a little stressful; however, on saying that, the camaraderie within the teams really is great, we all endeavour to help each other through challenging times and work as a team to get the job done."

The training courses available are brilliant, from Excel training to product knowledge, all courses are available to all staff. Everyone is pleasant and welcoming. The CEO always acknowledges you when he sees you, as do all management. We have annual staff events (summer events and christmas parties) which are a great way to mingle with staff from other levels of the office. There are a number of other pros for working for AFH such as:
- discount at local gyms

- great atmosphere working the office
- annual bonus
- secure parking
- payrise based on performance..
...The list could go on!!

Regularly throughout the year, the CEO and head of HR meet with a representative from each team in the Employee forum. They listen to ideas and ways to improve things from staff across the company. 
We have an intranet which keeps us updated on the goings on from across the business. The CEO also carries out presentations to inform us of how we are performing and again a chance to ask any questions we may have.

The staff within each department are lovely and you can make some great friends for life here.,"I genuinely believe AFH have a good offering for clients and try to put their best interests at the heart of the business decisions however in doing so they have completely forgotten about the staff who are the people that provide that back office service to clients. If your staff are happy, feel well cared for, listened to and fairly remunerated for what they do then they will respect the company and want to deliver a service to the best of their ability. If you don’t do these things, which unfortunately is the case at AFH, the reverse is true. They focus too much on ‘cheap labour’ and harbour an atmosphere of ‘us and them’ between senior management and staff. I genuinely believe the CEO wants to do right by the staff but he is surrounded by yes people who shelter him from what’s really happening on the office floor. They don’t look after their own, people who have been loyal to the company for many years, other than those who have made it to a seat at the board table. When it comes to promotions, they prefer to recruit externally rather than those with experience who have worked their way through the ranks which is often a cause of frustration for staff who keep being promised their next promotion is just around the corner. HR is a shambles and you wouldn’t want to tell them anything remotely confidential otherwise it’s round the office as gossip in no time at all. They certainly don’t want people who will challenge the order of things or suggest a new way of thinking. It is a shame as I think the company has a lot of potential but unfortunately, despite beating you over the head about being ‘the employer of choice’, right now they are anything but. The company is growing rapidly but unless they do something soon about the multitude of unhappy staff (I interacted with all the departments in the business and almost every single person felt the same way), the entire back office support system will collapse and they won’t have any long term, knowledgeable or experienced staff to hold the business up."
AFH-Wealth-Management,2018-12-11, Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,5,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,v,o,v,Supremacy,"Great place to have a career. I joined fresh out of university nearly 7 years ago. The company has been on an amazing growth journey, certainly since then which it has been a privilidge to be a part of. The below is a list of the benefits to me personally, and is not exhaustive.

-Scope for career progression to those that demonstrate the hunger and the skills required. It must be noted that you need to be realistic with your ambitions and a career is a career and not an overnight process. AFH reward loyalty, and if you demonstate the right abilities and attributes for more senior positions, combined with becoming an experienced team member and obtaining any examinations (if required), you will find yourself climbing up the career progression scale and experience the benefits that come with that increased responsibility. 
-Full financial support for relevant examinations which are approved by your line manager. I have had many exams and material paid for over the years which has supported me a lot and has always been fully appreciated. 
-The staff. Amazing, friendly people throughout the business and many friends for life who I have met through working there both past and present workers. This makes a working day so much better when you have good people around you.
-Package aside from salary includes pension, a reasonable amount of healthcare (primarily dental and optical) and an annual bonus. There have been sweeteners in the past e.g. share options which for a growing company can be extremely lucrative. There is also a really attractive tiered loyalty bonus scheme which if in it for the long haul can be very welcoming. 
-Social aspect is really good. Christmas party, summer ball, summer BBQ, and annual charity football match to name a few.
-AFH sponsor a charity each year and there are many interesting events throughout the year which staff are invited to join in on from conquering Snowdon, running in Birmingham 10k, skydives, pub quiz or just good old bake offs.
-Compressed working pattern offered to certain workers (not all). A benefit I consume and it’s something that is not easy to put a price on. A working week compressed into 4 days allowing for the same rate of pay, but 3 days off in a working week instead of 2. Something I put a high value on personally.","I genuinely have no cons to working here. You get out what you put in.

The benefits on top of your salary could be a desired addition to your employment, however, most people do not use said benefits so they are effectively nul and void.","The environment is extrememely biased in that if you are one of the chosen ones then your time there can be rewarding and enjoyable, however, if you are professional, accomplished and have experience from working in other estsblishments then you are seen as 'not the AFH way'.
The senior managment leave a lot to be desired. Most people there will hinder your career as opposed to progress it as it is a vindictive and malicious environment. The salary accross the board is undesirable in that 2 people could be doing the same role and the favoured party will be paid considerably more as they are a 'yes person' and most likely affraid to challenge for positive and productive outcomes. Contempt breeds with endless gossip. 
The investment ethos also leaves a lot to be desired and many other investment companies in the midlands have better returns in comparison and therefore are better businesses in practice.
The position that I carried out allowed me to gain knowledge of the business and its employees from a higher level of access and I am qualified to say that my comments are knowledgable and accurate.
Avoid AFH if you want to progress fairly and be rewarded for your hard work."

If you're lucky enough to get a parking spot in town (waiting list) - this is the most valuable benefit on offer (no really - financially the parking space is worth more than the pension). Easy life if you live locally.,"Pay in the Tunbridge Wells office matches the pay in the Manchester office so is CONSIDERABLY below market. I TRIPLED my salary within a year of leaving. Progression is limited and there is rampant favouritism and cronyism. No Salary bands are provided either so there is severe opaqueness in pay structure, which inevitably leads to huge turnover (over 30% in 2014, I believe) when people do learn of colleague's salaries.

The benefits, particularly the pension (3% matched - which by the way will be mandatory for all firms in 2018), are so terrible such that tea-making facilities are listed as a benefit on the employment contract. Ironic how bad the pension is, given that pensions form a large part of business. Other benefits: Death in Service (but only 3x). Town centre car parking, but there is waiting list of around a year. That's it.

They do offer to pay for training for the most basic qualification (the IOC), but very inflexible for additional training. They refused to allow me take time off for to do the study course for highly recognised CISI Diploma even though, because they refused to pay for it, I had forked out £1500 for it. They insisted time off for study come out of holiday!

Massive dislocation between the Tunbridge Wells (TW) and Manchester (HQ) offices. TW office ignored by the head honchos in Manchester as a satellite office, but still didn't have any autonomy (there was no single individual in charge of the 120+ staff at the TW office). Very disjointed management structures. HR were very disinterested and Senior Management are worse. When there were three consecutive years of poor results on the annual Times Best Companies survey - management told the junior staff and team leaders to identify the specific issues causing the disgruntlement, work out some solutions and report their findings to management (to implement, if they felt like it). Senior  Management didn't get involved until all the work had aleady been done!

There were also a lot of recurring problems,e.g. Data Protection Breaches that were being reported to the Board on a monthly basis, but the Board rarely, if ever, did anything about them. There was no top-down reinforcement of culture as the Board had no interest in the day-to-day running of what is still quite a small business, nor the staff."

My advice to anyone looking to work at AJ Bell is to use it as a stepping stone in your career. Get the experience, and the name on your CV, then get out.","First the minor points:
- Poor salary, consistently under industry averages for virtually every position in the business.
- Poor benefits, awful pension contributions for a company founded on pension business
- The company regularly promise improvements which never arrive, particularly the pay levelling of staff which ended up falling short.
- Very poor access to industry training, unless it makes the company compliant. Almost constant need for internal courses, though.

The major failings:
- HR department which is not fit for purpose, with ill-defined processes leading them to make things up as they go.
- Any time off you take is weighed up using the Bradford Factor and used against you, so there’s almost a fear of being ill.
- Sexist language is heard frequently, as are inappropriately sexual jokes. But, it's to be expected given the example set when Heads of Department are sleeping with their direct reports.
- Aggressive behaviour and language are commonplace. But they’re seen as signs of ambition rather than yet another troubling sign of a toxic masculine culture.
- Even more troublesome is the many stories of sexual harassment which are common knowledge, none of which seem to result in action against those men involved."

The salaries at this company across the board are very low compared to their competitors. The bonus is also extremely low and you have to constantly justify to your manager why you are entitled to a bonus in end of year reviews.

Salary increases are not actual salary increases they are just in line with inflation. Salary and bonus are not determined by your level of effort at all. No overtime pay ever available. Effort is therefore not rewarded at all at AJ Bell, you shall receive the same pay for whatever effort you put in.

Management

Management have little to no knowledge of the financial services industry whatsoever. They are just told by upper management to manage by fear and constantly harass and bully staff to work longer hours which is due to constantly being understaffed. 

Management also alter MI so that it shows a team is performing well when it isn’t which is lying to upper management. 

Culture

Some areas better than others but overall there is a serious issue at AJ Hell from managers to make decisions from fear of getting blamed. This creates an awkward environment where teams aren’t run properly. This is done so that they can then blame their staff members to avoid any accountability and use them as scape goats if anything goes very wrong.

Promotions

Promotions are never given to people who deserve them. AJ Hell is very backwards in the way that you can only get promoted if a vacancy arises for that position and not down to merit. 

IT systems

The systems are a complete joke there are always issues. IT are nice and friendly but have very little knowledge to solve issues. IT issues can remain unresolved for months as they can just open and close “calls” so it appears as though your issues are resolved.

Overall:

Good place to start your career or use as a stepping stone to advance your career."

If you happen to be paid more that the threshold, you are burdened with that responsibility your whole career.  No pay rises, annual increases even if you’re promoted! It becomes your fault someone actually paid you a decent wage. 

You are just a number, easily replaced and not valued. 

Never go against the gain- you’ll be as branded defector all your career. Feedback or pointing out areas of improvement goes against the totalitarian regime. 

Good people leave or randomly disappear- it happens a lot! 

Overworked- volumes are through the roof. None of the senior management have any concepts of the levels of work the teams are experiencing. It becomes very apparent when people leave and are replaced with two people (doing their position)  , how much they actually contributed. But to Senior Management you are just a number, easily replaceable, they don’t care! 

Goodwill is taken for granted .AJ Hell believe you should freely give this away and rely so heavily on this that people burn out very quickly. Though their goodwill is never shared.

MI- Senior management clown about in the boardroom, peakcocking about their made up MI stats in order to inflate their own ego! While the board clap their performance and the truth about their departments  is swept under the carpet.  

Overtime- you won’t get paid. This is where you are forcefully volunteering your services to help the rich people of AJ Hell get richer. Remember doing your bit for the corporate community service here! 

Don’t appreciate or recognise your service- one person apparently got a framed picture of them for working there 15 years. I’m sure a mirror would have been perfectly sufficient. Another said they got sandwiches made by a director for their 10 year anniversary and made to go on lunch with them. All thrilling experiences I hope. 

Best companies- very precious about this. Around a month before the release of the survey team leaders/ management turn into Gollum corrupted by a score for their area. Managers gave you a biscuit and let you sit at their desk when completing the survey. Like that’s what your aspirations in life are! 

Going for a promotion is a lot like being judged at Cruffs. They judge you on your appearance, how you parade round the office and how obedient you are to them.

IT systems are basically just pimped up fisher price computers. I once called IT as all the banks of desks would not log on. I was told to email a screenshot of this to service  desk! 

Volunteering and raising money - always volunteering activities but some ways of the raising money were a bit seedy. I was never a fan of sitting on Santa’s (directors) laps and paying him for the privilege of my bottom being in contact with his legs, then receiving a celebration chocolate as a reward for my endeavours.

Freebies- we use to get an Easter egg each year, after  becoming a PLC times were hard and a couple of creme eggs were scattered among the department, in a bird seed type fashion. 

HR - there is nothing human about them, nor do they have the resources to actually do anything. It’s basically do as I say not as I do."

The people are what makes going to work bearable. Most people are friendly and approachable, even some of the senior managers. There's are a few added extras that are good:

holiday allowance. Now starts at 24 and increases per full company year to a max of 30 I think. 

free on-site gym. There isn't loads of equipment but there are classes morning lunch and after work.  (Obviously not open currently)

nice offices that are modern. 

some fantastic colleagues that actually become friends.","Progression. Yes you can progress if your face fits and you don't disagree with a decision from the top. They have a habit of promoting some shockingly bad people to managers just because their face fits, never mind if they can actually do the role. It's not the case in all departments but just the majority especially customer services.  People have been told outright not to apply for promotions as they want external candidates but then hire someone internal the week after. 

A fair go. The company currently utilises the government levy for apprenticeships and this includes team leader and management courses. To be put forward for this course is by the heads of departments. It's a very unfair way of doing it as what a head of department sees Vs managers or team leaders is very different. Again it's a face fits issue.  

lack of support. There is very little support whether it be with mental health (there are mental health first aiders but this isn't widely used nor promoted), issues with team members (allowing members of the team to be negative and disruptive without any ramifications. Most of the time they think it's easier to just ignore the issue) or external qualifications (the apprenticeships are meant to be on the job however there is very little time allocated to help them pass) . If you have issues, they are just swept under the rug. 

bonuses and pay. Essentially you get what your manager thinks you are worth. If they don't like you (again your face doesn't fit) they will penalise you using your bonus and pay. You could have worked your behind off all year and you wouldn't get anything whilst the disruptive person will get a lovely bonus and pay rise because the manager can't deal with the ear ache. The bonuses aren’t assessed fairly and they vary department by department. 

poor pension contributions. Considering that AJ Bell are a pension company and have won multiple industry awards, the pension contribution is shocking. 

Some members of HR and learning a development are very supportive but their hands do become tied. 

All in all its not a horrendous place to work and I have worked in worst places."

This combined with the ridiculously high turn over of staff means no-one ever knows what they're doing, mistakes are constantly made and the workload piles up for the few experienced staff members to have to deal with.
- AJ Bell ensure that you can only progress if you are having marital relations with one of the managers, or if they want to have marital relations with you. Hard work is not recognised or appreciated.
- It seems that bullying is widely accepted throughout the company as the HR team have absolutely no power or purpose. If an anonymous complaint is made about a particular manager then it will always get back to them & make the situation worse. There are no consequences to their actions until the bullied staff member decides they have no option but to leave.
- The directors only care about lining their pockets and company image to protect their share prices - there is such a huge push every year to ensure the company survey helps them reach the Times top 100 company list, and if staff members leave bad reviews then their Team Leaders are punished by having their annual bonus taken away.
- Despite the compulsory staff attended biannual meetings the Director holds to boast of the sheer increase of growth and profits, pay rises were denied in 2020 for the majority of staff (aside from upper management)."
ALDI,2008-08-26, Area Manager,Current Employee,"Portland, OR",2,3.0,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,x,o,o,"""Beware all that glistens ...""","Experience, responsibility and the pay.","Extremely long hours for the sector (70+ not uncommon) and stress created by steep performance expectations with few resources available to run operations. Aldi is a discounter wih increadible prices for the quality but achieves this in a number of ways, not least by keeping staffing levels very low and driving productivity rates to levels not seen elsewhere. 

This all sounds fine, but in reality it makes for a tough working environment where your hours make up for the lack of colleagues - a convenient cost saving for the company, which employes well motivated individuals to achieve this.  At store level breaks are often not taken, or simply cannot be taken if the store is too busy because there is simply no back up. Some stores may be staffed by only two people and both may be required on the cash tills if the store is busy, to the detriment of all other tasks that need to be undertaken in the store. This is fun and a buzz to begin with but the fun palls as the reality of your working life sinks in!  The turnover of staff is prodigious - both self selecting and by the axe for those who can't keep the pace.

At Area or District Manager level, keen, ambitious, motivated people are selected to join the training programme with a healthy carrot of promotion opportunities and sector beating pay.  If you are attracted by this do a bit of due diligence before accepting!  The sector beating pay comes in annual increments - it doesn't start off fantastically.  This gives Aldi a chance to vet you in role first.  Fair enough?  Area Managers in training are used to run stores in preparation for their promotion to fully trained area manager - this gives Aldi a fantastic resource of ambitious thrusters to be used to run difficult and often failing stores for less than the price of a fully trained store manager.  An additional company benefit is that AM's in training voluntarily work any hours required (store managers often do not - mindful of employment laws!) to run their stores and will travel to wherever the company requires them to work without complaint unlike store managers.  The loyalty is one way however - a large number of area managers in training are needed at any stage to fill roles in stores and because few will make the grade.  A few from any intake will make full Area Manager and a few from this group will be promoted to Director in time.  However the rest will usually 'leave' after a few years providing advancement opportunities for the next group of ambitious hard working talent.

In my 3 years I saw in excess of 30 people come and go to service 10 area manager positions.  The clue is in how frequently Aldi advertises in the recruitment pages for these roles!"

If you do as asked and contribute to team Aldi has a lot to offer. It's very team work orientated and if you help out your co-workers and vise versa everything works as it should. Weak links are quickly pointed out though they do compensate for new starters by having an extra team member on for a week or so cut pick up the slack.

The pay is ok, but you do work hard for it. Shifts are usually 6,8 and 10 hours starting from 6am on an early shift or until 9pm on a late. 

Days consist of working working deliveries (main, bread, chiller, freezer and produce) produce can be hard work at 6am let me tell you! Working on till which is like nothing else. You scan as quick as you can for hours on end whilst remember fruit, veg and various other product numbers. It's easier than it sounds as you pick up the numbers quickly on the job. Then there's carding which is basically tipping out what left in boxes and rearranging the shelves and putting the card in the compactor. Then there cleaning up on the late shift.

Providing you show your worth on the shop floor you will find your self on the tills less.


Contract was 20hrs minimum but I usually averaged 30-35 per week. You got one Saturday, one Sunday, one whole weekend, and worked one whole weekend per month plus days off in the week. No complaints.","The main point here is that you work HARD for your money. If you're lazy, like the odd skive, fancy a quick smoke...Forgot it, you will not last a week. 

It's physically demanding, expect to lift heavy loads throughout the day. If you're ok with this you'll be fine.

ALDI,2014-11-13, Store Assistant,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","London, England, England",3,1.0,3.0,,3.0,4.0,3.0,x,v,v,My experience working for ALDI,"Great staff, decent pay, as many hours as you can handle. The staff I work with are great, including the managers, though obviously this could vary tremendously between stores and regions.
I'm never really bored at work. Angry, tired, happy... Sure, but never bored.","The rota can be an nightmare. Your shifts can vary so wildly from week to week that your sleep and social life will most definitely suffer. If you're a particularly social person and enjoy regular weekends out and being with friends you should forget about the job right now because I haven't had a weekend off in months. One morning you're up at 3am, the next you're not on until 2pm and so on... Basically it's very hard to have any kind of regularity in your free time because the rotas are so varied and inconsistent. 

There's also a lot of variation in the way staff are treated. The gents are expected to do more heavy lifting, more physical work and that's fine, sure, but they're also typically the last people to get the time off that they want. In my store it's all too easy for a girl to bat her eyelids and get whatever time off she likes. Likewise certain members of staff seem to get away with murder. They perpetually under perform (making more work for the rest) without any repercussions. 

There really isn't that much room for advancement. At best, after many years of thankless grafting you can make your way to store manager. The money at that level is good, yes, but in return you basically have to live in the store. If you've any ambition to make it into upper management you need to reconsider because there is no opportunity for store employees to advance to that level. They would rather employ people straight out of university.

My last little gripe is the uniform. The clothes are fine and good but men have to be clean shaven. This might not bother you at all but to me seems antiquated and discriminatory at best. There's no hygiene basis for it whatsoever. You are allowed facial hair for religious reasons though, which is almost more insulting. Beards are okay, basically, as long as you're the right race and skin colour."

I have worked for other retailers and Aldi are by far the worst.
When I started with the company I was working 40 hours per week, just what I wanted, but in the last few months my hours have been cut to around 24 hours per week, meaning that my outgoings are more than my take home pay. This is mainly due to a recent mass recruitment campaign where many stores have doubled their staff numbers, but hired too quickly and taken on many poor and incompetent staff.
The management do not care about staff, if you question any policy you are shot down and have your card marked as a complainer, meaning that you get your hours cut further and have even less chance of promotion.
The stores are really run by area managers who are usually 21 year olds fresh out of uni, who have no idea about retail and have never had a job. They have no personnel skills and no idea on how to treat or speak to staff.
Aldi will cut staff hours right back, but still expect you to be 100% flexible and will rota you to be off and then call you into work at the last minute. They will guilt trip you and you'll go to the bottom of the overtime list if you can't or won't come in to work.
The final straw came this week when staff were told that they would not be allowed to park in the shop car park over the 2 week xmas period, meaning staff now have to find a parking space elsewhere in a very run down area and will have to walk long distances to the shop. Aldi really couldn't care less about their people."

The store is closed on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day.
People I work with are nice, excluding managers.","As a Store Assistant, formerly a Stock Assistant, I can honestly say from my experience from these two positions that working for this company is the worst I have ever been treated in my life. I am expected to lift heavy objects from great heights, above my head height, and if I complain, I'm looked down on or guilt tripped with the ""this is a team and we all have to pull our weight"" speech, despite it being against health and safety regulations. My sleeping pattern has completely messed up with the 6AM starts one day and not starting until 2PM the next and working on until 3AM the next morning. The management tend to look down on people who are new starts or younger employees such as myself, especially if you're in some form of education as they seem to think that I must think I'm better than them for studying at college and only working part-time. I have been made to stay on past my finishing time almost every shift that I'm on without being asked, and if I ask to leave most times they point-blank refuse to let me go ""until all of the jobs are done"" and I'm not being paid for it. So this means I have no social life whatsoever and finding time to study has become increasingly difficult as I am tired all the time from work. I'm usually asked to pick up the slack for other people that haven't finished their tasks, and managers seem to have no qualms about patronizing and bullying you into it when you try and object. Despite complaining to my Store Manager about how I'm treated, nothing is being done about this. As someone who suffers from Anxiety Disorder, this has wreaked havoc on my mental well-being, and I'm currently applying for a new job after working for the company for almost 2 years."

On my first week of working as an Aldi Store assistant, I was treated so horribly. I was shouted at in front of customers as I made small mistakes due to members of staff near breathing down your neck as you try to get used to the tills. As I was young and quite shy, at first, they tried to push me further. Other employees didn't make me feel welcomed, the manager didn't even speak to me. It felt like higher up had forced the store to employ new people but the store and everyone in it was dead against new faces.
I remember on one of my first shifts, I walked home crying my eyes out because I couldn't believe I'd traded in my old job for somewhere so horrific.
The employees they told to train me, openly told me they didn't want to do training and were aggressive. It was like they wanted to scare me into quitting. They gave us a list of hundreds of PLUs and told us we had to learn a certain amount per night, I felt like I was being taught by Miss Trunchable from Matilda, no exaggeration.

Then there are the managers. In Aldi, there are LOADS of managers to every store and 99% of them are unprofessional, perverse and just in capable of managing. One particular manager would come in, his shirt unwashed, marks of food and rubbish down him, smelling. It was disgusting.
One manager would refer to me as ""sexy lady""... MANAGER. Once he even grabbed my shirt, pulled me into his face. I just didn't know what to do.
Another manager was forever angry, you'd think that being spoken to in a polite manner was a privilege reserved for birthdays. She would shout, scream, give you dirty looks and just on a whole, make you feel uncomfortable. Again, her hair was filled with grease and she was unpresentable, despite us new employees being warned that lack of presentation is an offence at Aldi. 

The store system on a whole is kind of like a hierarchy. You have the employees that are the same level as you but are clearly far more 'valued' than yourself. Without promotion, they were given manager keys, which is a sackable offence had they been caught by anyone higher up and would often throw it in your face. I had a number of these, 'elite team members' we'll call them, say to me ""We might be the same level, but I'm still higher"". 

They also make you feel guilty for being ill. During my time there, I got the chickenpox. God, you'd think I ordered them, they were so rude to me on the phone. 

In the end, I was signed off of work from my doctor who advised me to look for another job as I had to be put on medication for anxiety due to Aldi. 

I provided sick notes covering my absence but, low and behold, they didn't even pay me statutory sick pay in the end, which again is illegal.

I handed in my notice on the 10th of January and when that letter came through the post to say I officially didn't work for Aldi anymore, I literally could not have been any happier!! 

Honestly, unless all you care about is money and are happy to be treated like mess on the bottom of your shoe, I would highly recommend you work anywhere else but Aldi. 

You have to ask yourself, why do they need to take in so many staff if it's such a great place to work? Why are they constantly hiring? Why is everyone leaving? 

i thought it was just the store I got put in but reading this reviews it just seems across the board it's just in general an awful place to work."

I recieved disciplinary for arriving 15 mins early and getting onto shop floor 10 mins before my start time. Deputy managers are just kids with no training/ management experience hence they act the big man because of their job title. Was told to speed up on my second day, even though i didnt know where the products go yet. my speed got faster but then recieved a disciplinary on my 2nd week for not being as fast as people who worked there for 9 months. Was told to come in at 8.30 am for an induction, but was actually there to be sacked for the disciplinary thing before i had even worked another shift after the diciplinary, so had no chance to even try to improve. Also worked 9 hours wihtout a break and yet 8 hours in i was asked ""why are you slowing down"". Actually felt relieved when i was sacked. Overall a terrible job."

Started doing 30 + hours per week with 3 people on the shift, now expected to do the same amount of work but in 18 - 20 hours per week, and with only 2 people on the shift instead of 3. No pay rise or incentive to do extra work expected.
I arrive at 10pm for the night shift, and will be told my finish time when I arrive, which will be anything from 4am - 8am.
Was told during induction that nightshifts are blocked together to help the nightshift have more regular sleep patterns. Hardly ever happens. Everytime a worker leaves theyll be hundreds of applicants willing to take their place, Aldi know this and exploit it to the max. They keep prices low by screwing over their work force. You must be clean shaven for every shift, no designer stubble at all. And you are told you cannot say anything negative about Aldi on the internet or social media, this a an instant sackable offence.

Monthly wage slips can vary by a couple of hundred pounds each month but I've personally felt very comfortable knowing I'll be able to afford end of month bills and still set some aside.,"If you are a part/full time student, doing night classes or show any passion for bettering yourself, then you have no chance of stepping up the ladder in Aldi.
It is understandable that the company does not want to spend time training someone for a promotion if in the end they will take a desired job else where if offered.  From the employee point of view, there is no incentive to work hard because you are made to feel unappreciated and blatantly told that you will have no future with the company unless you fully commit to it as a career.  Some employees have kept their aspirations and target dreams job a secret, in the hopes of being promoted (for the wage increase) so that they can sooner save up and leave Aldi. 

There is a culture of bullying among all levels within the store and this is common nation wide.  Troubled managers are simply transferred to other stores rather than being dismissed from the role or demoted.  These troubled managers face no threat of punishment for their behaviour, thus they continue treating staff badly because they know that they will get away with it.  

Food storage standards are pretty low within some branches.  Some stores have small warehouses but receive large deliveries of chilled and frozen products.  What can't be stored in fridges and freezers is left to float around the warehouse for up to 12 hours, reaching room temperatures or actually becoming warm if left near air conditioning units.  These pallets of chilled products do finally make it to the appropriate storage, but not before reaching dramatic changes in temperature.  

The recent Channel 4's Dispatches episode was only presenting the tip of the ice berg when it came to staff moral and low levels of health and safety.  One example of unnecessary pressure is that til staff must scan over 1000 items per hour or face a disciplinary.  If a customer is physically slow, elderly or disabled, no exceptions are to be given, you still must scan as fast as possible and it is up to the customer to keep up with your pace!    
Staff who stack the shelves have strict times to keep to when working each pallet.  There is no time to fetch a ladder or carry it around the store.  You are encouraged to climb shelving, while balancing heavy boxes in one hand.  Whatever the customer doesn't see, doesn't happen in other words.  
 
Aldi employ a lot managers who have left other supermarkets, after talking to them it would appear the cons listed above are common across the board."

Their expectations of employees regarding palette times is incredibly optimistic. Just watch the undercover show on channel 4 regarding Aldi, its absolutely true. This is mainly due to the fact it doesn't consider customers asking for advice nor a small warehouse in my case. Unlike other supermarkets you also have to do the picklist which isnt in alphabetical order, its all random.

This ultimately will be what causes you stress, Aldi's targets, if you're on tills it's about items scanned.

Some days I go into the warehouse and see the stock and just know I'm getting a ""written conversation"" this company doesn't care about your circumstances nor you. 

Aldi absolutely uses intimidation in order to push their employees to work faster, for example, if you weren't fast enough expect a disciplinary. They will keep warning you ways of getting a disciplinary to scare you into working more efficiently. They use fear because they know most their staff won't be able to find another job easily and they can replace you quickly.

Aldi also believes that 4am is sociable hours. If you're doing a night shift then only 4 of your hours will be night pay. 

It is very likely that you will have to work an entire part of the supermarket on your own. 

Don't expect a career here.

I understand if you're job hunting this seems like a good choice but believe me just move on. I already made that mistake."

I was looking for a change in career and after a lot of research, thought and analysing I decided to apply for Aldi as they appear to be a great company to work for. I applied for assistant store manager and was surprised at how lengthy the whole process was - I saw that as a positive, thinking the company invest a lot into their staff. Nope, that was completely wrong. 

I left my already good job to go onto Aldi (which I thought would be a great move for me). From day one I realised it was the biggest mistake of my life. Firstly the hours are a joke - as an assistant store manager you're expected to work a MINIMUM if 48 hours and then everything else on top. Aldi will tell you over and over again at interview, in their books, in their manuals that you get all this time back - IT IS COMPLETE RUBBISH, DO NOT BELIEVE IT. You also get a day off: if you class your day off as sandwiched between finishing at 11pm the night before and starting at 4am the day after. I came from a job where I worked 12 hour shifts and worked hard - I am NOT afraid of hard work, however Aldi is a complete joke. There is no way (unless you're Superman) you can get everything done. Oh and on your day off, you're expected to trek all the way to the store to hand over the safe key, which takes over 2 hours in total - which you're not paid for. This happens at all of the stores, so just bare that in mind if you actually have a life outside of work. 

Also the bullying culture is horrendous, you are told as a manager to micro manage all of the store assistants and watch them on CCTV constantly to try catch them out. The store manager left me on my own to close up the store after I'd been there for less than a week, then the next day decided to watch my every move on CCTV in fast forward and show me where he felt I went wrong. It was awful - constantly criticised for everything. Whatever you do it isn't good enough. The poor store assistants are given impossible tasks to do just so they fail, this is meant to be some kind of character building exercise but I fail to see how it builds anyone's character other into wanting them to leave. 

I left without a second glance - I'd rather sweep the streets in a snowstorm wearing nothing than work for Aldi. It was the worst experience of my life and even if you want to raise a complaint on how you're treated, they won't let you. Hence why they can say their staff are so happy - they literally will NOT let you complain about anyone senior. 

Area managers are a joke and are all straight out of uni, have no social skills and talk to other human beings like dirt. 

So, if like me, you were looking for a change of career - keep scrolling. Aldi will run you. Don't do it."

Managers are liars. No free time or weekends. Shifts ochestrated so you can't do anything in your time away. Eleven hour rule only applies when it suits them. Nothing you do is right even if you follow instructions to the letter. The people that are promoted are never the right ones. Hard workers are ignored and the ones that suck up are the ones promoted. You are threatened with disciplinary if you don't cancel plans on your days off to do extra shifts, don't stay back late or go in early. You have to be 100% flexible for them but they aren't even close to 1% flexible for you by not giving you time off you request months in advance. You have to live, breathe, eat, sleep and talk Aldi 24/7. Your private live is secondary to them and it does not matter what is going on Aldi have to come first, second, third, fourth and fifth. Everything that goes on outside Aldi is a privilege and you should thank Aldi for it because they have the attitude that they make everything good in your life! It couldn't be more wrong! They drag you down, they belittle you, they lie to you, they lie about you, they take away all your self worth and they make it so you are scared to ring in sick then chastise you for going to work sick, they make it so you are frightened to ask for time off because as previously stated your life revolves around Aldi and nothing else once you start working there. You can't ask for help as you get threatened with disciplinaries for not being able to do your job even tho you are asking for the help to be able to do that job."

This helps to make the job easier and you can make some friends along the way.

Challenging, rewarding work - The workloads aren't for those who don't enjoy physically challenging work. However, if you achieve the often difficult targets, it is rewarding to do so, and you often find yourself going home knowing you've done a good days work.

Management - The management in store are down to earth and often understand you, and want you to progress. They set you long and short term targets, and often give and request feedback on how you are doing at work, which helps to set realistic long term goals.","Shifts - Shifts often change at the drop of a penny and you are expected to adjust to any changes made, even if you planned otherwise prior to this. 5am starts for days on end can also become tedious. however, once you finish, the rest of the day is yours!

Targets - Even though Aldi is known for its difficult pallet time targets, it is often shocking to see how quickly you are expected to get stock onto the shelves, even if you are understaffed on some days.

Basically the Um and Ah for the complaint period (7 days) so you never get it rectified. 
The benefits package??? Don't make me laugh. It's totally useless. Even if it was useful, you'd not get the chance to use it as your entire life is Aldi. The shift patterns are extremely undesirable. When doing the rotas they seem not to consider whether or not you need to sleep and eat. 
Wake up feeling ill??? Don't even think of ringing in as not even death is an excuse as to why you can't make it in to your shift. If you're lucky not to get screamed at for ringing in and you get say three days off sick, don't imagine it'll mean you've had three days off sick. They use the Bradford Factor and you end up with a crazy score at the end. I had four days off (not in a row) and I scored 16!!! It's a system to stop people taking the you know what. Which, of course, is not fair to people who are genuine. If you look the Bradford Factor up you'll see that it is described as short-sighted and unsuccessful. I'm not surprised Aldi chose that system.
I went to Aldi knowing it would be hard. The work is back breaking and there is no let up. It's like you're expected to be in many places at once while a negative atmosphere swirls around you. Instead of training me properly I have spent almost my entire time there being screamed at. Due to said atmosphere, the team structure constantly breaks apart and the jobs given are done half-assed. I mean who wants to work really hard at 6am with a manager stood over you constantly spewing negativity all over you? So I don't blame them but sorting their mistakes always seems to get me in trouble!!
Each manager has their own way of working the shop floor. Sometimes it leaves my head spinning as I just don't know how to do anything without upsetting at least two managers. You have to keep changing the way you do things. That being said, if you're a ""favourite"" you can pretty much do as you please. 
When I say ""favourite"" I am of course referring to the Store Managers ""Click"". If you're not in that click, woe betide you. The you know what will be flung in your direction.
Managers get in trouble for not being negative enough. I even have an idea that they are not allowed to be positive. Anyone that threatens the balance of this 1950s structure is out. Transferred without being asked. So do I want to be promoted? No. 
The money is just not worth it for any level. 
When it comes to your health, sometimes they can be sympathetic, that is until they realise it will mess with their productivity. Work place accident? About six months in I had a serious accident that involved me going to the hospital. On returning to the store I was told I might face disciplinary action. They really don't care about your well being.
Before anyone who reads this review and judges me as a disgruntled employee, I'd like to say I'm not. I am actively seeking employment elsewhere. I am resigned to my current fate. I just want people to know what it is actually like."

- You will have a very clear idea of your responsibilities and your daily tasks
- Has a very distinct corporate culture (punctuality, strict chain of command, easy to identify someone's position and area of responsibility, politeness).
- Frequent updates on how the company was doing, including with the head of IT
- I felt managers and directors were all approachable
- Very strong interaction with the business.  Had the opportunity to understand the business concepts.
- Some roles offer time in Germany (but not all).
- Very pleasant working environment in terms of desk space and decor.
- After 4 years' service the pay is above average.
- Interesting and fast-paced industry.
- Good work/life balance (8:00am-4:30pm no expectation to stay later).
- Free fruit, tea, biscuits and coffee!","- Not really got a grip in the IT department on how to progress people.  Too much relies on how much your director thinks you're the right 'kind' of person.  Some directors only have frequent contact with certain team members due to certain projects which means they don't spend enough time with the rest of you to understand more about the type of person you are.
- In Aldi's IT, industry standard practices, whether it be Agile project teams or concepts of the way a developer operates in a standard setup, are not followed and it feels disjointed.
- Career progression between the standard level most are employed at and management level is very difficult as the intermediate stages are viewed as project manager/senior business analyst type roles and are not suited to more technical roles.
- Pay starts below industry average for most experience levels for a standard role, therefore may be better suited to those with little experience or performing a career change.
- Considering the size of the company, they should be able to afford more role-specific training.
- If your beard is your pride and joy, don't come here or failing that find God (all men must shave, except for religious reasons).
- Due to office layout, it can get noisy.
- If you can't cope with a demanding workload, don't come here.
- If you can't shower and dress smartly..... don't come here."

So Aldi bully store managers and then it trickles down to store & stock assistants. I worked at AlDI for over 12 months after leaving the HM forces and believe today this day that I was treated unfair and disrepeacted and bullied. I got spat at my a duty manager and pushed into a mirror but nothing was done about it. It was my word against his so there was no trust and no loyality and integrity at AlDI. Yet they expect us to have all those things but when they dont okay by the rules they expect us too. I would highly reccomend that if you are looking to apply at AlDI prepare to go through alot of mental and physical challenges and never believe what the managers say they just like to squeeze every bit of energy from you and then let you quit and then Aldi can hire somone else. That's Aldi's game plan.

I appreciate shop talk at work is important, but on a 3 hour drive there should be at least a hint of other interests.

Honestly, 40k and an Audi sounds great, but you will end up forgoing some pretty valuable years of post graduation life. You've waited 3 or 4 years to finally get a salary and ditch the student digs. Don't waste it by shooting for a high salary and missing out on a life. You'll end up a pasty, overworked, underweight and frankly very boring individual.

P.S you friends will think you are boring if you take this job - it's a unavoidable side effect - selling cabbages is not interesting.

I now work in Tech, Make more money and have regular working hours that mean I can enjoy a work life balance. If you're passionate about retail and not much else then go for the AM grad scheme. If you have any other passion, creativity, outlet you need to be willing to sacrifice it. When I read similar reviews in 2014 I thought.. It can't be that bad. It's honestly not worth it."

Personally I was denied funeral leave by my area manager ( a contractual right) based on lack of staff, yet they claim to be all about their people. Occasionally show a good attitude towards work life balance but you’re expected to work a MINIMUM of 48 hours a week with no real upper limit. Some of my colleagues regularly work 60-70 hours a week and many experienced salaried managers have either left or been pushed out due to this. By and large the ones who never say no and sacrifice everything for the business get the promotions and the good will.

- Great people to work with (dependent on the store you work at)
- Paid break (but there is a downside to that too!)
- Company benefits such as discounts on some places.","Where do I begin:

- The time to unload pallets of new stock is incredibly unrealistic and you are often stopped by customers to help them with their enquiries. 

- If you're working a delivery shift, the delivery is sometimes late meaning you won't get out on time and have to find other work to occupy yourself. Even if you still don't get the delivery finished on time despite it not being your fault that it's late, expect a written conversation.

- Maximum of 30 minutes break, even if you are working a 10 hour shift which is not enough in my opinion when working in a fast paced environment like Aldi, where one easily become burned out. 

- Some shifts you are stuck on till all day, even up to 10 hours. 

- Shoplifting; the store that I work at has had an increase in shoplifting. There are no security guards employed to protect staff and customers from people who will harm you if you dare to get in their way. 

- Be expected to work like a robot!  

- The work life balance is terrible and barely given any thought; my social life has suffered because a lot of my time is taken up by working! 

- High staff turnover. 

- Never enough staff around to get the job done; if the store is really busy, most of the staff in store will be busy working away on tills. Which means you sometimes might end up collecting all of the empty cardboard boxes off the shelves after the store is closed, so in other words don't expect to finish your shift on time!

- Sometimes asked to come into work on days off at the drop of a hat.

- Rotas are changed often, meaning that you have to abandon all the plans you have made on your free time to come in to work. 

- Don't expect to get given a party at Christmas.

- No staff discount."
ALDI,2018-08-28, Deputy Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Edinburgh, Scotland, Scotland",1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,x,x,x,"""Real life Shawshank Redemption""",Only pro is the extra pound an hour,"Theres never enough time to complete tasks and no room for any curve balls. Work scehdule is unbelievable, one week it's 6am starts and the next it's evening starts and this rotates weekly. Work life balance is destroyed, it's bad enough the place is under staff, you're expected to do the work of two. You're having to come into work sleep deprieved aswell, this takes it's toll. Expect wrinkles fast if that's not off putting then also a lower life expectency. 

Management is full of bitter aggressers, bit like the guards in Shawshank. Feel as if the title gives them license to do and say whatever to those without. And that there are superior to those below them and it's stems from the top. But this is odd as it's a job that requires little to no education to enter, hard to understand where the superiority comes from even Area managers simply need a undergrade degree of any discipline to enter. Perhaps it's the lack of knowledge that creates this higher status mentality within management steming from the top. 

Area managers are younglings straight out of Uni with no life experience, this is again to get the most out of them working 60-100 hours weekly, as they don't know any better and have no other commitments at that age. Bit like the stock trading sector in London however the ones Aldi employ tend to be entitled narcissists with type A personalities, that only require a degree in any profession to enter the position and it's as they tend blame their ""training"" for any and all errors and mistreatment of stuff and their own personalities. So they tend to struggle to relate to staff members of any age and also behave in sicklical ways. Much like children, they will engage in wars with individuals whether it be store assistants or managers. This stems from the belief that I have this title so you must see as this way and act this way, my behaviour may resemble that of a 12 year old and I may seem 300 miles away from what an area manager should be but  you must act as if I am warden and address me as such.

The worst of it is nothing can be disputed, their word is law these kids are not watched but left alone with thier magnifying glass. It's deeply demoralizing for the people working around them, recieving constant feedback on trivial matters, passive aggressive tactics and no oppurtunity to explain yourself as anything like that is viewed as back chat and the penality is cold shoulders and a loss in the oppertunity to progress in the company. To top it off there is no way to change this as these kids are the way makers and get away with acting like Jeff Bezos from his early days at Amazon and are more obtuse than the Warden out of Shawshank, the staff have no option but to take it on the chin like a man(because thats how men should be) and quickly lose their mental state for an extra pound over other retailers. There are no possible ways to speak to someone to solve this problem even the area managers themselves can't be reasoned with, you are classed as nothing  but low income earning trash by a Sports Science graduate recovering from his 21st. 

Look for something else unless you are don't want to deal with all that, not an isolated incident happening in many of these stores.  Have worked with company for 4 years been in 9 stores in 4 regions, it's same everywhere. But if you wanna feel anxious at work everyday maybe it's for you, I was gonna call this WORST RETAIL JOB OUT THERE but I think ""Real life Shawshank redemption"" is more fitting, creates a more fitting portrayal of Aldi life."

Like many others I joined with the intention to work my way up to the ‘Aldi dream’ of a company car and travel to the promised land, this is nothing but false hope.... unless you do the graduation scheme straight out of university there is no such thing to work towards. In turn this means the highest rank you can work up to is assistant store manager which would typically take 3-5 years, not bad right? Think again. This role will only ever be offered to you through working like a slave week in week out with utter consistency for the full duration. You will consequently dedicate your life and sacrifice in some cases family and any hobby’s you have to reach this role. Once obtained your life will then be Aldi, Aldi, Aldi, you will be on a salary and work a minimum of 48 hours a week with one day off. Throughout an Aldi career you will also be subject to critical judgement and there will be no praise for doing something great however do something bad/unsatisfactory and you will be shouted at and in some cases punished with a warning. In conclusion a job at Aldi is a life sentence of dedication and sacrifice as you serve a prejudicial hierarchy, I am left asking, how can a job as simple as stacking shelves and serving customers become so glorified and yet behind the scenes resemble slave labour?"

High turnover of graduates taken on who after initial period are let go – as company wants continuous fresh talent & ideas!

Inadequate ride on trucks to do job, constant pressure to load and go leads to stress hanging around to get to store in time! 

Disgusting toilets facilities in the RDC. Insufficient facilities for the very high staff on site. 
Massive trailers of food waste binned which could be redirected to homeless or those in need. Very small % is actually given
Lack of maintenance inside & out i.e. loading bays not working/ out of order for ages, pathetic red pieces of card used hung on inside bay doors to indicate a bay is in use implemented by management to prevent significant numbers injured loading HGV’s where driver driven off and staff fall from height!
Crap safety procedures to limit accidents happening. 
Pickers occasionally collapsing at work in the aisles.

My 'mentor' told me I wouldn't need the postcode of the stores 1hr away and proceeded to drive off down the M1 at 80mph leaving me inevitably lost and stressed, a great way to start! 

Training is non-existent, they'll drop you into a store and expect you to just know how to do things and complete tasks at the same speed as people with years of experience, just madness. 

I was asked by my 'mentor' to reprimand a Store's Assistant Manager with 10+ years experience on my 4th day. Because I did this tentatively (as I think most people would!) I was told 'you've been here for a while, you need to toughen up'. 

Generally work 60+ hours weeks which was expected given the salary. HOWEVER the way the shifts are spread out  (6am or midday starts) means your sleep pattern is ruined. Once did a shop inventory and worked 6am-11pm then back in at 5am to finish at 5 that afternoon. A healthy 29 hours worked with 6 hours between shifts (2 of which driving!)

As other people elude to the other Area Managers are fine, except from the ones who have been there for a few years. One told me with pride how he had worked a 110hr week which gives you some idea of their mindset.

Once had to drive for 6 hours on my day off as a store manager had locked the key in the safe so backwards and forwards from the head office. Led to me falling asleep whilst driving (you need the days off to catch up!) and nearly crashing which ultimately made my decision to leave much easier."

Lack of trainings. Very demanding although cannot accomplish that themselves.

Here are the main phrases I heard everyday during my near 10 years with Aldi.

1. ""Work harder and faster"" no matter how hard or fast you are working, it will never be good enough. There are no excuses.

2. ""You can't go home 'til it's finished"". If it takes an extra 6 hours after a 10 hour night shift, tough luck. 

3. ""Your thanks is your paycheck"" never expect a thankyou or well done. That's what is expected of you, because Aldi pays you the extra pound an hour. Anything less is unacceptable.

""I just go home and drink"" I lost count of how many members of the management team give this exact answer when speaking about how they cope with the pressure."

Never working here.","Bully culture, discrimination, homophobic and racist. 
Management are the worst I’ve ever come across. No empathy, couldn’t care less. 
Workload is mentally and physically unmanageable, impossible timeframes and absolute chaos. 
Customers are the rudest I’ve ever came across.
No work life/home balance. Minimum contracts, higher contracts always promised but nothing ever comes of it. Extra hours are not always available and inconsistent but still expected to work over 60 hours at Christmas. 
Pay has been so misconceived by outside sources. The pay is actually awful, they never pay you right. Always feels like they dock you and leave out hours of pay. You are too exhausted at this point to even care or figure it out though. If you leave, they don’t pay you at all so don’t work notice. Just leave on payday, go work at Tesco for 10p less and without a workload of 5 robots. 
No advancement opportunities, most managers are 15 to 20 years in, in their mid 40s or 50s and the area managers who boss them about are straight out of university 20 year olds. They are clueless and never last even a year. Don’t believe the lies, don’t waste your time. Do not ruin your life. People try to commit suicide on a Monday and get invited to a formal disciplinary hearing on the Tuesday. 
I’ve never seen a company who has no duty of care for there workforce as Aldi. Worst company to work for, period."

No others I can think of","Reviews
1.	Consultations on colleagues performance irregular - affecting conclusions.  Positive service feedback unreported.
2.	Review process done wrong - wrong issues included, ie health, others not, long term goals.  No mutually agreed reports
3.	Vague goals/ negative ‘constructive’ feedback– consistently insufficient detail on performance related to goals, affecting ability to improve.  Management told, just said improve, little training.  Comments - negatives written, positives turned negative/ ignored.  Positive corrections (wrong actions, no positive feedback) considered good review approach. 
4.	Actively used to replace existing staff, knowledge/abilities ignored.
5.	Review meetings irregular/rare – no time to correct behaviours.  Management view final, implication read and sign forms, input unwanted, answering back.  No real discussion.
6.	Management failure to resolve issues – unable to recognise, seek solutions for months, despite told.  Stated unwillingness to train.  Some issues resolved by others, others never.
7.	Email comments by staff – management happy to say situation different if gives their desired impression/ fail to act on them.  No clarification sought.
8.   Judged negatively for failing to do jobs not done at all/ or hardly due to lack of opportunity. 

Training - Multiple requests for external training.
1.	Only in-house - If external desired, own time/self pay.  Research from TV/ online.
2.	Automatic training requirements following reviews - fail to inform staff
3.	Staff training – not recorded or discussed after, any issues wrote refer to training.
4.	No one departmental approach to jobs – all doing differently, one way, one person fine, another wrong.  Seen in multiple tasks.
5.	Admitted inability to teach essential skills – to senior management when judging staff for lacking skills.  Some training only provided by colleagues.
6.	Training – hands on avoided, verbal short, then go, no written departmental targets.
7.	Reluctant to invest in training/MBTI/Learning style assessments – time away from work

Unsupportive management
1.	Outgoing management kept quiet – officially following viewpoint required by those staying, quietly saying they were helping, they and others say staff doing well, substantially improving, rarely officially raised or recorded. 
2.	Job description changes, staff unaware - Management unconcerned, despite having judged staff on unknown changes.  No investigations/apologies.

DISABILITY HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT/ MANAGEMENT
Even supported management made little effort to communicate with staff different from them.
1.	Rigid Official Review performance targets - naturally biased against many disabilities, don’t recognise strengths due to communication styles. 
2.	Disabilities - unable to understand effects of Autism/similar conditions.  Judgement on ability to do work based on assumptions.

Attitude changes - no safety issue, no preventative action
1.	Sharp, ANGRY management corrections – apology given, say will positively correct if see others doing same thing, in same way as just been corrected.  Suddenly no issue.  
2.	Correction for actions - displaying flexibility due to others action’s.  Manager enters, no questions, one person blamed, another takes blame.  Suddenly no issue, manager sharply says do properly, leaves. 
3.	Wrong correction by official trainer – they apologised, issue not raised in recent training.

Good relations management relations not encouraged – unapproachable, untrustworthy
1.	Negative service comments from customers – not acted on
2.	Negative comments when systems introduced – at times avoiding potentially life threatening/ unpleasant reactions, following training.  Told to stop, time wasting.
3.	Angry/sharp/aggressive management style - if not get desired responses, or when help sought.  Reasons not sought.  Experienced by many.
4.	Consistency sought by Managers – managers routinely inconsistent - opposing approaches.  Desired approach changes, staff not told in timely manner.
5.	Incorrect/negative information given by management - to staff concerning others, affecting departmental relations, corrected by team members.  No comment on improvements. 
6.	Unknown issues - Staff considered failing for not providing solutions, these not sought once told, negative written comments.

Poor Management – Higher management aware of issues.  No attempts to clarify.
1.	Unable to calculate increasing workload - reduced staff, at full stretch, told to cope. 
2.	Output more important than health – health issues causing time off/affecting work considered valid negative review issues.  Management concern - staff stressed, not reasons.
3.	In-house medicals, flu jabs etc – managers don’t tell you, attend in own time.
4.	Approved holidays not recorded - multiple overlaps, short staffing, stress.  Consultation avoided further clashes.  Staff falsely blamed for not following procedures.
5.	Rarely recorded contributions – not pass on changes in contribution requirements in timely manner, contributions not recognised.
6.	Communication poor/non-existent - targets, meetings, procedures etc.  Negative feedback, different systems, inability to prepare for meetings, stakeholders not told of changes.
7.	Communication flexibility not required – If initial approach fails, other person blamed.
8.	‘Discussions’/ Mentoring’ one way - from manager.  Only very precise phrases acceptable.
9.	Poor Staffing/ work/ life balance – Staffing levels insufficient, temporary staff avoided.  Stressed staff told to cope. Overtime essential (pressured to) in quiet times.
10.	Solutions – Only management ways wanted, others discouraged, including previous good systems.  Ideas led to accusations of inability to cope, and blaming staff for failing.
11.	Management felt unable to listen by staff due to confidence loss – therefore did not raise issues/give explanations, denied it was their problem. 

New management lacking essential knowledge
1.	Failed to know staff - assumed abilities/learning styles - wasted time ‘teaching’ unnecessarily.  Staff (perm & Temp) leaving, with useful information. 
1.	Tried to hide mistakes - even when made aware.  Resolved by speaking to higher management.  Multiple mistakes.
2.	Management told something possibly not know – regular, sharp responses.
3.	Claimed issues not raised with them when they had – they had dismissed issue.
4.	Removed systems preventing issues - commented when re-occurred, solutions not sought.

Favouritism
1.	Staff made official first aiders, receiving full external training before probationary interview.
2.	Some temporary staff retained once not needed, most go immediately. 
3.	Some if they hate a task, removed from it.  Others must do as allocated.
4.	3 month probationary reviews – Most done after 4 months, favourites promptly, noted. 
5.	Manager away, very new staff put in charge of team, despite lacking knowledge.
6.    Some staff offered chance to attend events, others not.  Some on weekdays, some weekends.  Others not even asked."

Badly managed employee engagement policies lead to colleagues believing that Asda is a benevolent entity rather than a business.
Over reaction to KPI's on a daily basis instead of action on a consistent basis affecting the whole operation and customer experience.
Satisfaction at work can be linked to how you get on with your boss. During my time I found that many are interested in what you can do for them, without any reciprocation. I found very few actual leaders amongst the GSM population. Many were managers without any leadership qualities, and several lacked the intelligence to hold a position with that level of responsibility."

They don't train you to any where NEAR the required level to actually do your job, then moan at you because you don't know how to do certain tasks that you should have been trained to do to start with.
Other department managers will demand you work a certain part of the shop floor, irrespective of the tasks you've already been given by your supervisor or your own manager. If you get pulled up on why you're not doing your assigned tasks, you get chewed out publicly on the shop floor by firstly your own manager and then the manager that told you to do the job in the first place.
Colleagues spend more time chatting each other up and flirting with each other in store than actually working, leading to explosive relationship breakups and fights in a rather public forum. Despite their ""Always help the Customer"" attitude they teach you, if you get swamped with customer requests you're branded as a slacker for not getting your own tasks done.

This is bad considering many of the staff are on a low income, jobs have been lost and its a clear gimmick to help boost sales as staff will have no option but to purchase food from the shop floor.

While I don't personally benefit from a lot of the financial benefits due to not getting out much (Like restaurant discounts, theme parks etc.)  there are a lot of benefits that colleagues can take advantage of.

But those are just minor niggles to me, the problem at the moment is the management restructuring. There has been virtually zero communication with the colleagues about it and moral is generally low as a result since obviously a lot of the managers are well liked and are being moved, stepping down etc. Lastly, the daily huddles are never communicated with the colleagues and are just written down in our canteen to read and just seem so condescending and come across as it's the colleagues fault when the company are overspent on wages and has nothing to do with the management's, mismanagement."

This meant I ended up working 18 hour days at least 2 - 3 times a week. If you ignored this unspoken rule your department would be 'walked' the next day and a multitude of mistakes found. Department managers are encouraged to bully the colleagues in their department in order to meet excessive targets.

I was able to work around my timetable for university and also pick up quite a bit of overtime along the way. Although I didn't want to progress in the store whilst being in eduation there was a lot of progress within and many of my colleagues progressed to shift leaders and management. I progressed myself within store and was able to gain experience from all areas in the store, however this may have been because i was working in a small supermarket. When leaving University I also was able to pick up hours and move to cash office instead of checkouts.","As said in the title the job does get tedious especially on checkouts, but that is to be expected consdering it is quite a repetitive job. Also there was alot of times when we were without a superviser and left to work on our own. Also within supermarkets colleagues are expected to have knowledge in all areas of the store and have to deal with problems themselves. There were also many occasions where there is a high shortage in staff i believe this is due to limits on hours able to give to staff by management."

Discount is OK, double discount days before Christmas.  Staff all tend to be in the same boat, so everyone tends to get along.","The hands-off approach I mentioned?  Thats because all the managers are sat in the canteen drinking coffee and sucking up to the store manager whilst you're grafting.  When they *do* grace you with their presence they tend to be rude, abrasive and/or completely incompetant.  I've been threatened numerous times by managers for such heinous crimes as wanting to finish on time, asking for my breaks and asking for money to keep tills stocked several hours after I made the initial request - oh, and refusing to sell out of date stock.

I applied for a free apprenticeship and was denied, upon learning that I had applied to go to college - something I couldn't do if I was already enrolled on an apprenticeship scheme - I was miraculously granted my inital request to be on the apprenticeship.

When I complained about management victimisation there was an investigation launched.  The investigation comprised of asking the manager in question if he had bullied me, then telling me I had made it all up.
Almost every member of my department had backed me up and told me to complain that I was being victimised, and almost every single one of them would have provided evidence if asked."

I started there when I was 17, at this point I had just started my A Levels and it was great as it was really flexible hours, which fit around my studying. Decent pay for doing an easy job. Worked with some great people, had a laugh which made shifts go quicker. I worked on George but it would have been easy to get overtime on other departments.","A new store manager started and then things started to go downhill. He would wander about on his mobile phone when things needed to be done, and just moaned about them instead of doing anything to help. It got worse when he thought it was acceptable to talk to me like I wasn't capable of doing a job I had been doing for 2 years (which I had won awards for doing a good job), and so I spoke to him exactly the same, which I got pulled into the office for. After that he constantly harassed me at work, pretty much watched everything that I did and got other managers to spy on me (how professional). Got pulled into the office after this for a number of times, one which included being pulled in by a different manager for having 'purple hair' when it was simply platinum blonde/grey, which the people manager even came in and said 'what is he going on about purple hair?' and walked back out again. It got to a point where I could not even be bothered with the hassle any more, and so when I got another job (in which it is actually acceptable to express your opinion) I didn't think twice about leaving. I guess it is luck of the draw which managers you end up with but in my experience the managers have their favourites, yet the company as a whole boasts about diversity meaning that there is less bullying and harassment.

The crux though is that every section leader knows they have very little chance of developing into managers within the next few years due to the restructure, 7 in 10 want to leave because they feel abandoned by the company.

They can and will stab you in the back if it can benefit them in some shape or form. They never have a view of the bigger picture and generally are not properly trained to be in a higher role. 

Managers and section leaders potentially lack the ability to lead, inspire and promote a healthy working environment and instead opt for bullying tactics, guilt tripping and backstabbing just to get work done. Even then, the work load increases and yet the time to do so decreases. If you work too fast, you are accused of cutting corners, if you work too slow you are told off for not working to the best of your ability. ... Huh?

Being guilt tripped and potentially black mailed into working extra shifts.

If you are not part of the 'inner circle' or so to speak, prepare to be moaned out if you so much as have a chat with someone for less than ten seconds, yet you will see the managers and their lackies wasting time in the warehouse for minutes on end. 

Terrible pay for the work you do; it is far more stressful than they would have you believe, and the ideals of working as a team is garbage. You either suck up to your 'superiors' or you will not have a good time.

I made a lot of fantastic friends with an employment span of less than a year. Everyone was absolutely lovely and helped me settle in well. The colleagues, supervisors and even the store manager were always friendly and always greeted me as if they had known me for years. It was easy to forget that it was a job because it was so friendly and relaxing. I really enjoyed all the new technology they were bringing in as well, such as the scan and go and rapid scan machines. Getting trained for these new machines was exciting and gave us a chance to promote our work places without having to be salesmen. Talking to customers was always nice too, it was good to know that being chatty and talkative was part of our job role, which made working there even more fun. I was given weekend hours contract due to being a student, which was actually tailored to benefit me which I thought was great because it meant that they had my interests in mind when deciding my hours. They thought it would be best for me and it was, meaning that I had a good work-life and education balance. The chance to be rewarded for our work was also good because I received an Asda star for getting 100% happy to help which I wasn't even expecting, making me even more motivated to get more.",Only thing I can say is that working on a checkout for hours on end is tiring and sometimes painful.

Upon joining I got a warm welcome from colleagues and they made me feel like I had been part of the team as long as they have.

The job can be very varied and also is quite entertaining, it is also nice to be appreciated by some of the customers for a good job.","The biggest problems I see from working at Asda all relate to the short termist view of managers and head office. For example they will make decisions based only on the here and now, without considering the potential impact of the decisions, that often leads to bigger issues, which they then pass the blame on to other people.
Another problem is the way that some managers will promise things like help or progression and then conveniently find ways to avoid their promises, which causes many staff to be demotivated.
There is also a distinct lack of progression despite what was advertised when I started. It also seems to be based on who you like and how long you have been at asda rather than your abilities and management capability.
There is also a distinct lack of appreciation for good work, new ideas or use of initiative as well as an expectation that you are always available.
There are also problems with visits from other managers as the store panics and ends up stressing everyone out to get things perfect (which they should be anyway). 
They managers and business also seem to ignore the company values such as respect for the individual and always having integrity. 
The final issue is that most staff are usually overstretched which leads to more sick days and even more overstreched staff.

However a lot of the problems stem from three areas, one is that the night staff seem to get away with doing far less work than the day team. Two the managers are unwilling to solve issues due to the coflicts they would have to resolve with the night team and also head office. The third restraint is head office who seem to have unrealistic expetations and don't like hearing the truth it seems."

then, to make matters worse, asda has a ""fair policy"" on management and supervisory positions, where people who have worked for a long time get the opportunity, but instead they gave it to a power crazed, sadistic lunatic who's only goal was to make people miserable, because his life was miserable, who had only been there a couple of weeks! 

then there was the staffing issue, i was contracted to work 6-11, then i took on night shift overtime, commonly working 12 hour night shifts, however, during my contracted hours, i noticed that soon people began to leave, they weren't being replaced, so then there were around 7 employees, working 32 aisles of rather large palettes which are meant for a minimum of 12-15 people, and then expected to finish by 9 o'clock in order to cut down paying hours, it was ridiculous, we were practically forced to leave early on some nights, as there was ""nothing to do""."

Managers do not seem to work hard at all, instead preferring to sit in the cafe and delegate tasks. Cuts have wracked the shop, leaving areas under-staffed and inefficient. Nepotism and favoritism is rife - hard working colleagues are completely overlooked for promotion in favour of colleagues to prefer to gossip and make friends with the managers. Managers themselves are condescending and disrespectful. The working environment is poor. Working your way upwards if you have been put on a certain section of the store, for example porting, is essentially impossible, leading many people to leave after a while.

- Flexible working hours with contacts and plenty of overtime to fit around your personal life
- Discount card 
- I had a very good department manager who was understanding and got along well with (not all department managers were like this tho)
- Good experience to learn about retail and add to CV","- Stressful environment with a lot of pressure from senior management at times
- Can be quite demanding for the wage you are on, most of the time you are expected to do mission impossible 
- Full of immature older women to just look down on everyone and talk about each other behind their backs
- Depending on department it can be quite a 'mind numbing' job as you are on your own most of the time (customers aside)
- Some training is irrelevant, for my discount card i had to do an online test about disabled parking? and other topics that weren't related to my department in the slightest
- Thrown in at the deep end, you are expected to know everything from day one, includes knowing were all items are and a 20min training session on tills (Believe me customers will make your life hell)
- A lot of managers seem to have 'Big man' syndrome and seem to think because they have a tiny bit of power that they are some kind of god
- Arrogant GSM who gets paid a six figure salary to basically walk around the store all day thinking they are a ""god"" and making colleagues lives hell, from a business point of view ... wasting money big time
- Quite a lot of department rivalry
- If you are que busting from shop floor then you have to deal with ancient tills which have buttons missing and can be quite confusing at first, also a lot of the ""runners"" are very rude and throw a stop when you ask for help
- Never feel appreciated
- The 'Stepping stone' programme is basically a dead end job, all though i think they are scrapping it now with the new management structure ( section leaders basically get paid an extra 60p to take the blame for everything and get shouted at constantly, known so many people who have stepped down) 
- Full of ""Brown noses"" and ""Favouritism"" which is very frustrating at times
- Short staffed all the time, for example i work on a sunday on a very busy department and we usually have three people in unlike saturday when we have about 10
- Lack of motivation
- Unrealistic budgets"

I have recommended working here to others, including my sister who is currently waiting for an interview.","It can be quite a challenge to speak to the head of department, or there can be communication issues between shift managers. an example of this is that, as a seasonal member of staff I was informed after Christmas not to work, then told I could do overtime shifts, then was informed by a shift manager that I should have been doing my designated shift, but had never been informed of it previously. Another issue I have is that the office staff leave quite early on in the day so if you work mostly evenings like myself it is difficult to get in touch with them for things such as new uniform, or in my fellow colleagues case, arranging things for her pregnancy such as clothing, as hers no longer fits her."

- The 10% discount comes in handy.
- Certain benefits are decent, but a faff to arrange.","- The pay is terrible and massively below the work expected of some.
- Most of the managers are incredibly cliquey and will treat you like something they've stepped in on the street unless you brown nose or are sleeping with them.
- A lot of managers and section leaders are young and have very little retail or people experience.
- Many of the older colleagues can get away with whatever they want as the aforementioned young managers are too afraid to discipline them.
- Our GSM, who joined our store 7 months ago, hasn't said a single word to me and many others.
- Equipment is woefully out of date and incredibly unreliable (across the entire store).
- Colleagues that leave are replaced after months rather than days or weeks, if at all.
- Because of this, departments are understaffed and the colleagues there are expected to pick up the slack.
- The store is always messy and dreadfully understocked.
- Most customers are fine, but there are more than enough who are downright rude and look down on you.
- Our canteen has recently changed to serve breakfast only with vending machines for the rest of the time, yet Asda wants colleagues to live a healthy lifestyle.
- The yearly ""Your Voice"" is routinely ignored by management.
- Management only care and make a real effort to help on the shop floor when there's a visit, because a bad visit could lead to a dressing down for them. If this effort was made for customers the store might offer a decent shopping experience and also make things less of a panic when there are visits."

Things on the nightshift have got worse by the day over the last year especially. There is staff leaving all the time and they don't get replaced. The extra slack is obviously picked up by the remaining staff. The company are squeezing us to the point everyone feels like giving up. The moral has gone so low that after being around everyone after only an hour of starting work you feel the need to run for miles. The company honestly doesn't care about the nightshift in the slightest. They also closed the canteen down for us (but not on days) which is a massive blow for many of us who loved a hot meal to help get through the shift, especially when we have more work to do than our skeleton staff can cope with. Not had a one to one or anything of the like in over 4 years. The pay was fine in my opinion but as things have got so bad now I feel the money isn't even close to being worth it. Can't really bring myself to do overtime anymore as I'm just too tired. When my days off come round it's really hard to switch to get Into day mode in order to see daylight, family/friends, get to places before they close like banks, hairdressers etc. really isn't an easy way of living life so when you're only getting paid so much and things have gotten so bad it's just not worth it anymore. I'll admit I'm having a rant here but don't be mistaken in thinking I'm alone in feeling like this, as it truly is mirrored in every colleague in my store on nights. I'd happily go on and on but as always...I'm too tired and can't be bothered. It's not like someone high up is going to read this and think things need to be improved.

It can be a monotonous job, very process orientated, you will feel like a bit of lacky.

Its not glamorous

The pay for ""normal shift"" (days) is a little over the minimum, not bad at all but nothing amazing. 

I've had the good fortune of having great managers, they're very personable, approachable and empathetic to their team. This will differ from store to store obviously and there are some insufferable managers I've heard though."

When I was completing the survey, another manager was stood over our shoulder watching, me and another employee had to ask them a couple of times to move away and I could still see them lurking in my peripheral.

2 Ruthlessly Austere, they sack managers and employ colleagues as Section leaders, on a fraction of the wage.
3 They mislead customers with ""rollback"" offers. The company does not mention that they put the price up on the product a week before.
4 Very little communication between anyone.
5 Poor Professionalism. People applying for jobs and finding out they were unsuccessful when someone starts the job they applied for. Section leaders finding out someone else, in the store, is in line for their job before they have been told to step down.
6 The companies values and the charity work are not genuine. Its just to try and create a good public image. Basically a PR ploy.
7 Staff are on minimum contracts, yet are often encouraged to do overtime. This is so the company can save money on holiday pay.
8 Working Christmas eve or New years day is usually time and a half. A terrible rate.
9 Most colleagues over 40 have physical disabilities to varying degrees. This is due to the nature of the work and the speed required to carry out the tasks.
10 Promotion usually means you get a full time job, but spend most of that time still filling shelves. The only difference is you get a small pay rise, and you are expected to cover holidays and sickness. Basically, they have you over a barrel."

Some of them are still optimistic and perhaps more thick skinned than I am. They do an amazing job, are still pleasant to talk to and are optimistic and ethical, hard working. I applied for Asda because the employees seem happy, so I presumed they are treated well as employees. Now I know that it's part of their personality. Not situational.
- After 3 months of working here, I got my discount card which is appreciated
- Benefits
- I haven't been asked to do too much overtime, but that's because I mentioned to them my health issues at interview as well as had a telephone session with occupational health as I realised I would need to look out for myself
- Sometimes, management can be professional and compassionate, but it really depends on how the person is, has nothing to do with any leadership training or understanding that people need to be treated with respect
- I'm earning money after being out of work for a year
- I work part time so have days to recuperate 
- Interview was friendly, if a bit non representative of real working environment
- Windows in the store. Huge ones. They allow us to get real sunlight. One of the main reasons I chose this role over John Lewis.
- Learning curve for me about work in retail - how to discern between truth and embellishment, and about lowering expectations.","- Checkout colleagues have no idea what's going on since they are not allowed to join the company huddles (meetings) when they occur. In fact, I had gone into work early one day and joined one and the store manager was UNHAPPY and mentioned it was strange to see a checkout colleague at a huddle!
- Company values about respect for individual do not seem to be reflected in the way I have personally fund management to behave
- Management is stressed and overworked, which has been taken down to section leaders. They always seem so stressed and overworked... and then it goes onto the shopfloor staff. I hold compassion for them, yet surely effective leadership training (LDPs) would benefit all.
- Ineffective to no communication
- We are just numbers... I try my best to not allow it to get to me, but I don't feel valued
- Variable moods of customers and management. I feel that there have been times I have been talked down to by management, and its unfair as I am reasonably sane and intelligent
- We haven't got proper chairs on checkout, and it will affect our spines and health. I choose to stand because it feels less dangerous than sitting on broken chairs.
- Very minimal and poor training, expected to learn on the job. Only one day of watching training videos. Which is true, yet it affects service in store. I had a customer shout at me for not knowing my job. She was right. I didn't have training to help her in that instance.
- A lot of things are not on the system, customers constantly ask me to check if something is on special offer as advertised, because they are so used to having something being advertised on offer, but not on offer at the till
- We don't have fridge freezers on the till, so A LOT of meat and other food goes as waste. I feel sad that customers do not value food at all, or choose to put it back themselves if they change their mind and that we are under-staffed so the runners cannot always be putting back food.
- I filled in a survey regarding my opinions around a month or so ago. Was an opportunity t speak up, but as it was towards the end of my shift and I didn't have time to plan my responses, perhaps not entirely representative of my views. 
- The term ""overspending on wages"". Understaffing affects service and the holistic health of those colleagues who are encouraged, persuaded or choose to take overtime. Loads of it. 
-Customers come first, then the company, then management... which doesn't seem to tie in with an egalitarian view I held.
- This might just be particular to my store, but it seems that management are not too concerned with the sometimes less than professional attitude of certain colleagues, even when it's flagged up. I get a few colleagues who make me feeel uncomfortable working there, so I have forced myself to ignore them when I am genuinely a friendly person.
- It seems my store is not the only one with similar issues, which is why I finally chose to write this review
- I do not feel happy or valued here, and therefore due to situational reasons will not be able to continue for very long, as my mental health is beginning to suffer due to stress and disappointment. Being forced to resign is a con in any workplace. Welcome to the real world, I guess"
ASDA,2015-01-01, Section Leader,Former Employee,"Aberdeen, Scotland, Scotland",3,3.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,3.0,v,r,v,"Great place to be a colleague, tough life if you want to progress","Great benefits. A lot of folks have been with asda a long time so there's a strong sense of belonging. As a colleague you are well looked after with plenty of options available to you for shift swaps, 'me time' (unpaid days off). In my store there's always plenty of overtime available and I believe this is the same for most stores. 

I would recommend working here as a colleague.","Recent restructure of management has seen the opportunities to progress beyond Section Leader diminish. It is however far easier to become a Section Leader and due to the need to fill all positions in the last 6 months, there has been an influx of inexperienced people stepping up (think straight out of school and never had a job, let alone worked in retail) leading to increased pressure on those of us who are experienced, as we have to keep them above water as well as doing our own job.

When area managers come to visit there is a mad rush to get the shop looking its best, quite often with managers/section leaders putting in extra hours to bring up the standards. In my opinion, senior management should see how our stores look on a typical day, with the budgets and resources we have.

There has been a recruitment crisis in the Aberdeen area recently, mainly due to the fact that you can get an entry level position in an oil industry office and get paid more than in a supermarket. Again this has led to the employment of many who otherwise wouldn't get through group selection, simply because they are an extra pair of hands."

Leadership/management. Just not the right people in charge.
They employ and promote family members foremost. Almost everyone in an asda store is related to someone. So there's people not getting jobs after a perfect interview and people getting jobs that have no work ethic.
Rotas are done the day before the new week and you're expected to adhere to this.
No career progression. They have restructured management letting go 50% of department managers across all stores and hiring a lot more team leaders to work crazy hours for hardly anything more than an average colleague. They promoted people to these roles through favouritism and the easier ones to mould or manipulate (with no chance of progression you wouldn't work 50+hours a week for 70p more, nobody would).
They expect you to work to the point you are sweating and pay you buttons for it.
They don't allow you study leave like they used to or career breaks.
They monitor a lot on camera now. Don't know if they have been asked to do this. 
Management cover for one another.
They monitor your breaks when they have no reason to then take excessive breaks and extra breaks.
I've seen good colleagues who are hard working being squeezed out the door. 
The values of the company that were presented to me when I initially started are completely non-existent.
As they have cut back you are forced to do jobs you weren't hired to do. If you don't comply you are presented with an ultimatum. 
They used to give you incentive to carry out your job to a high standard with gift vouchers etc. however they have stopped this. 
You get 10% discount which isn't great and a double discount day however on double discount day there is less discounted items than any other time of the year.

The company have made changes to staff on a mass scale, in a short period of time - which should have never been done internally. The speed in which the changes have taken place has been the main issue. The main reason asda has done well is it's relationship with the customers. Colleagues who are unhappy will find it hard to maintain this. You've dug your own grave. This has been since late 2014.

Supportive leadership, especially with applying for the grad scheme.

Flexibility with hours if in education, ability to move stores for summer and Christmas breaks.","The colleague experience differs a lot from store to store, due to different management and different parts of people policies being enforced.

Technology is lacking. Everything is second hand from Wal-Mart and it doesn't feel like there's any investment in trying to make colleagues jobs easier. If DVDs and CDs were tagged automatically at the depot then it'd enable MVG colleagues to focus on refill than tagging for hours on end.

No way to search for stock/location, there are 400+ DVDs out in the charts alone - you can't answer customer enquiries efficiently. Location changes on telxons a few days before modular implementation so restocking can become hard.

The photo kiosks take up a lot of colleague time, customers don't get the software. In my store the MVG and Photo Centre is joined so one colleague is doing what two colleagues would in another store.

Your average supermarket bonuses","Along with the pro's some of the senior management can be very rude and very unprofessional. There is no real communication between management and your average colleagues. This is potentially down to some in the higher positions being disassociated from your average colleague. It's understandable that they are subjected to preassures from people in higher positions again but they does not warrent the behavour that i've witnessed for example. 

Before therestructure there was blatant bullying from department management, there would also be preassure on you to work when you've expressly said you won't. Often this would be ignored and you would be informed you are working and that is the end of it. I have personally been bullied by a previous manager, however no one would openly say anything and I did not feel comfortable taking any action because all the management are friendly with one another and openly discuss everything. I felt it would lead to further bullying. 

In the colleague handbook it is fairly stated that you will be required to work flexably within the store and undertake an array of tasks, which is fine to a degree. However, hours get cut and they give out the minimum amount of hours then when things suffer and management come asking questions, as to why departments are half empty or shelves in disaray they are not satisfied with the response that you are short staffed due to lack of hours and refusal to recruit. As seasons become busier it becomes near impossible to complete work handed to you, as you are expected to undertake large amounts of work that ideally require at least 2 or more colleagues. It can be exhausting. 

I'm unsure if this is the same for all stores now but within the store I work, they are expecting everyone to become till trained to queue bust but this leads to you being stationed on a till for around an hour or more of your shift leading to the department you are also expected to work becoming neglected and work not getting completed which leads to unhappy section leaders/managers.

They seem to recruit relations within the store. Nearly everyone is related to one another across departments. So gossip is a widespread, especially from management. Confidentiality is non-existant. Colleague investigations for example get discussed openly within departments. 

The new restructure changed the order, as in you now have; Colleagues, Section leaders(replacing section managers), main managers then, the store general manager and their Sub general manager. They have eliminated the title of a Section Manager but have given all the duties to the Section Leaders for a fraction of the pay. From general chats with my own current Section Leader they are expected to do a lot of work for hardly for very little extra money. 

Training is quite poor. You get your expected on paper training, watch a lot of training videos. Practical training isn't fantastic, not within my department anyway. I was employed as a Baker, yet when my old manager was in charge, I was expected to persue my own training from the other Bakers, which is fair, I have initiative and would ask but would be met with, ask the manager, or sort it with them. Over a year down the line and it has taken that long for me to be allowed to progress with training, I have become quite set that I will never complete Baker ""training"" to earn the Bakers wage. Despite working as one for a year, I do not feel I have been paid fairly for the work I have done. You are required to use the ""guns"" within your job. No training is provided for these though then you're looked at a bit foolishly for not knowing what to do. 

Last but by no means least, it is an extremely thankless job working for ASDA. Equipment also needs serious updates across the stores. Lastly, god forbid you become ill, 12 weeks is all you get, if you're not fit and well by then you can expect to be let go. Their own ocupational health can override your own doctor too from what I understand."

My review is based on the Frozen Department.,"I used to love working at Asda and could see myself staying there for some time, but since the 2014 restructure, Asda really has gone down hill fast.

Share save scheme is a good idea with a possible good return on your money.

Benefits like the cycle to work scheme and discounts on days out, attractions, holidays, restaurants etc.

Little bit of an yearly bonus but if you break the bonus down weekly doesn't really mean much as we are on such a poor wage anyway.

Store discount card helps a little.

Really great shop floor colleagues without these guys Asda would really fall to bits, Not sure if store management really value colleagues . . . Its only them that are keeping it going after last years restructure.","Lack of colleagues on day and night shifts, Too much stock that we don't need coming in from Asda depots despite stock issue and P.I. process, Too much work load for colleagues.

Store itself is falling to bits and not fit for purpose, Store is too small for the growth of Home Shopping which has a knock effect to the rest of the store plus store was never built to take the stock levels and money it takes every week. Health and safety issues in store and tight budget to get things fixed, Closed staff canteen to save money.

Relying on the few colleagues to do overtime to keep the store running and the shelves stocked,

Customers becoming aggressive and more ignorant due to products not on shelves because of colleague shortages, There needs to be some basic rules in supermarkets to protect staff and stock in shops i.e. not eating as you walk around, Dumping fresh food, Shop lifting etc. I know they pay the wages but some people really do take the mick.

More pressure on colleagues. If you don't cover holidays you are left with even more to do on your return from your holiday or day off. No colleagues to cover you as there is no one ( or nobody wants to work in frozen )

Not sure if some managers are up to being mangers, Some can't manage there way out of a wet paper bag. Some store management seem distant and aloof.

So many fellow full time colleagues have left my store, People leave but are not replaced or replaced with part time inexperienced students. Also Asda doesn't like full time colleagues anymore . . . they cost too much !

Better pay structure, Asda as a store has so many diverse departments. Some departments have it easy while some departments have it hard in relation to the work they do with no difference in hourly rate and pay.

I know retail is extremely tough at the moment with the supermarket price wars, But the management in Leeds live on another planet and seem intent on destroying Asda. 

The management restructure of 2014 made the better managers redundant and replaced them with less paid  inexperienced section leaders and was supposed to put more colleagues back on the shop floor which has simply not happened.

Some of the section leaders have stepped down in there roles in my store because of work pressures. There is simply to much work to do and not enough people. 

Maybe there is some kind of master plan to all the extreme cut backs Asda are making. All I have seen is customers shopping elsewhere because of empty shelves as a result of colleague cut backs which equals less money being taken at the checkout as products that customers want to buy are not stocked.

So much fresh store waste being thrown away, Again being created by too much stock coming in and not enough colleagues to put the stock on the shelves . . . Its a real shame seeing good food being thrown away because of being out of date. I will never forget Christmas 2014 by the amount of waste being thrown away some of which never even made it onto the shop floor, Just crazy:-(

I think Asda now is all about % and figures. As long as they balance the store books waste, wages overtime, consumables etc to what the store takes in sales every week nobody really care's:-( All smoke and mirrors and robbing Peter to pay Paul:-( and not about the customer.

Met some great colleagues which I will miss, But have now left Asda and looking forward to the future away from retail."

This is normally then told to everyone else as confidentiality does not exist Managers cant wait to tell colleagues what has happened in a investigation . For such a so called ""GREAT"" place to work the turn over of staff within Teesport in its 9+  years of been open is huge this in itself speaks volumes as to what sort of place it is.

Queue busting and q clarity is a stupid concept, I feel as if I'm getting into trouble whenever I get called to queue bust, if I go I'm letting my department down and section leaders are often angry at the fact I get left on a checkout for 1hr+ but if I don't go then it's unfair to checkouts as I am down as queue buster and it means those that do go to queue bust are kept on for longer than they need to be - it is a no win either way, if I go or if I don't someone isn't happy, I'm confused even though I'm just doing my job.

Lack of training on checkouts, as I'm a queue buster I'm often left to figure out how to handle situations myself and kind of figure out things as I go along, I've been working in asda for 8 months and queue bust frequently and have only just figured out how to do a top up on checkouts ??!!!

Manager made me sell a woman Paracetemol over the legally accepted amount - I was told initially this was a fireable offence but then treated like a jobsworth when I tried to enforce it. If someone didn't turn up to relieve you, you were expected to wait until they said so, even if that meant staying an hour after your shift ended.  Rules changed depending on who it suited. Again told that I must never, ever leave the till unattended - when I called a runner to fetch a replacement for a customer (something which is a huge part of their job...) I was told to stop being lazy and go get it myself, leaving till unattended for a few minutes, only to be told off by a 2nd runner on my way back for leaving. Management were also extremely clique-y and the environment was very toxic. Food hygiene rules utterly ignored - a pack of raw meat burst on my till, spilling meat juices everywhere, but once I'd cleared up the obvious evidence on the belt, I asked to wash my hands and they said not to bother, and if I was going to be really that fussy I could spray my hands with the industrial disinfectant.

When working well its a great atmosphere. 10% discount is quite good n the occasional colleague discount days they have where we get more didvount is even better.. great breakfast served from the canteen  (always look forward to that)","1)Hours kept a minimum yet work requires more...
 2)Told we have to take holidays when they want so they can save hours to fit in with the restrictions on hours.. 
3)When a staff member is ill or on holiday it is rare that they will cover them so other already stretched staff are expected to take on yet more work.
4)With hours restricted, the little staff that are on have to prioritise jobs resulting in other jobs getting missed such as racking of over stock which then lead to stock going out of date in the back and later being wasted., restricted hours also lead to us rushing our jobs and date checks on shelves is not thorough leading to out of date stock still on shelves which customers have been known to point out to me and my collegues leading to embarrassment for us and asda, it also leads to  high waste which then leads to staff being lectured on waste volume but it is the structure they have on hours that causes this and they have their selves to blame no one else!! Yet they dont seem to blame them selves..
5)Hours restricted and jobs not getting done properly or not at all, leads to empty places on shelves resulting in customers commenting to us about it and again resulting in embarrassment for us and asda. 
6)already stretched on our own departments when queue busting is called we MUST go and work on a till wether we are busy or not (we are always busy) they have bern known to take me and the only other colleague on my department to queue bust leaving our department without a staff member for sometime.
7)Our rushed manner results in us rushing to take customers to products and not giving the full expected customer service that asda insist on and we are being tested on this via secret shoppers it is easy to fail given the amount of work we have and our rushed manner. This is not a fare test
8)better turn over leads to more hours but the restrictions on hours leads to poor turnover which then leads to restrictions in hours!! = we just cant win
9) when we are getting supposed surprise visit from the area manager, we know they are coming because other stores phone and warn us. Suddenly they are able to phone staff and ask them to come in and dish out a load of hours, all work is done as should be because there is enough staff! ...The store doesnt really work like that!!  But this proves it can if the right amount of staff is on
10) staff have been known to clock out and continue to work just to complete jobs they don't want to leave half done purely coz they dont want to let the team down.

It's a smaller local supermarket and I like the fact we form a relationship with customers.,"Although I don't mind, and at times really enjoy the tougher shifts; there's far too many tougher shifts which seem to be an uphill battle. 

This is usually due to the decisions made above us, like ridiculously low wage budgets, overly complex processes for what should be simple tasks. An awful ordering system that wastes so much time and money delivering what we don't need and a lack of what we do need (despite so much time invested in the processes).

As a Section Leader I feel I'm overworked and vastly under paid. It feels like we have to do the work of a Colleague plus a Manager as well as our own duties. We're often the Duty Manager for long periods and dealing with quite complex problems. I enjoy this challenge but feel I should be rewarded for it. I get just above minimum wage for this! 

We are under trained. I did my ""training"" over 3 weeks when I joined from Netto. It was basically a box ticking exercise. A series of people reading to us from dummy cards. If we asked questions we were usually met with the same answer from all, ""I don't know, this isn't my area, I'm just covering"". We then had to sign to say we'd had that area of ""training"".

We often make the joke, ""in order to progress at Asda, you have to sell your soul to Asda"". We are expected to do long shifts. We're contracted to 38 hours but it's taken for granted that we'll stay til a job is done. This is frustrating as the job would be done on time and to a better standard without the fact we're working with one arm tied behind our backs by those above, managing their figures to look good at our expense.

We learn as we go along, pick up new skills from other Section Leaders we meet and always have the feeling that we're missing something.
We have so many people in deadwood positions visiting, demanding we follow their rules and processes for their particular area of concern. It's not nearly possible to find the time to do any of this for even one of them. Never mind all of them. These are people simply trying to justify their job roles. 

I don't believe this is unique to Asda, it's the down side to working for a big corporation but it's just magnified ten fold when working in a small building.

In order to get on, you have to play the game. You'll thrive if you accept the bull, talk the talk. Say the right things, then when you get above, keep up the presence as though you didn't experience it yourself and carry on making the decisions that cause those bellow so much stress.

I have no ambition to go further and stay in this job as it's just a convenient location to me.

I will move on when I find a better alternative."

There is a great team spirit as everyone mucks in to help each other get the job done. 

Customers are usually nice, understanding and have low expectations as it is known as a cheap shop.

They do sometimes promote from within if you are willing to put in the hours and sing the corporate song - literally!

You will be busy, busy, busy which is good for people like me who like to feel useful not bored.

If you can handle the workload, at shop floor level it is not too stressful as section leaders and managers get all the heat.

Given how disorganised things are, it is very easy to get away with doing little to no work (also a con!)

Good union presence has led to reasonable benefits and treatment of most staff, or at least paying lip service to same.","Ridiculous pressure is put on section leaders who receive a very low wage for their level of responsibility.

Dead-end job: There seems little point trying to progress as you can work a long time as a section leader and never make it to management. Many section leaders step down again as it is a nightmare job for very little reward.

Chronic understaffing which only seems to be getting worse. There is never enough time to do a job properly, so most jobs are rushed and left half-finished by staff. Queue-busting (leaving your job to help out on checkouts) just exacerbates the problem. High workload and low staff leads to stress, staff absences and resignations, which leads to even lower staff numbers, ad infinitum.

Rotas are rarely updated on time, badly planned and sometimes you will find out after the fact that you were meant to be on shift. Due to low staffing and overworked section leaders there is often a lack of communication about rotas which leads to problems like this.

You are often alone on shift which is fairly miserable. Some people use this as an opportunity to do no work, which means more work for their colleagues who come on shift after them.

You have to work at least one day every weekend, and often evenings as well, often at little-to-no notice.

10% staff discount is lower than other supermarkets offer.

Lip service is paid to things like Health and Safety, which is then routinely ignored if it gets in the way of doing the job. Basically you have to sign a form to say you are aware of all H&S issues and will report any, the sole purpose of which seems to be to implicate you personally if you get injured at work. Eg, In my department's section of the warehouse the fire exit was routinely blocked by rails of highly flammable clothing which had nowhere else to be stored. This was hurriedly hidden elsewhere before a senior management inspection.

Store management at local level are doing the best they can, but can only follow the instructions of their corporate masters who turn a blind eye to anything inconvenient. They are all about numbers and don't seem to realise overworked, stressed, untrained staff will have a negative impact on their bottom line eventually."

You might as well sit on a checkout (no offence checkout people!) and earn the same money.

The shift patterns, for me at least, are rubbish. Friday, Saturday and Sunday every week, when there are other staff who don't seem to do any weekends or night work. Guess it depends on the length of time you've worked there? It would make more sense if it was done on some kind of rota system, then at least I'd get to spend some weekends with my kids!

The management are terrible, no communication, constantly shanging my shift pattern without actually notifying or asking me. The senior management don't seem interested in even saying hello to you!

That is honestly it, and that is the only reason why they have staff. There is 0 job satisfaction.","Management are useless and pretty much non existent. Managers are always changing, so you don't get a connection with anyone.

Equipment is outdated (why are we still using a dirty keyboard, have you seen sainsburys and tesco?) Every checkout has bits of equipment missing (eg. Important phones to contact the runners) we have to wave around our hands waiting for someone to see us while the customers are getting frustrated at waiting in the queue and taking it out on us.

Never get your lunch at the time put down, (your name ""accidentally"" gets crossed out because they thought you've been already) always have to nag staff walking past that you haven't had your break yet. The excuse is ""we don't have enough people to do breaks"" Yet you see plenty of staff standing around chatting doing nothing!

You get left on the self checkout by yourself. This is impossible to control by yourself and very stressful. This ASDA must lose so much money from all the stolen goods at the self checkout. It's impossible for one person to control.

These may not seem like really big problems to some but they are when you're doing this type of job.

Everyone on checkouts has these issues and more! The turn over is so high people are always leaving.

ASDA don't care though because there are always students and desperate people willing to work for them because of the pay."

Management look after their own, they have multiple prolonged breaks where they get takeaway food and treat select colleagues, but everyone else is timed by the second. Working in Langley mill you are not likely to get the job if you are not related to management, in which case you don't need any skills or qualifications. People work hard, others will just show their face and chat for 4-8 hours, but everyone is paid the same. If you are a section leader or manager you can walk around the shop and do your shopping during your shift, you can also take items off the shelf and pay for them at your convenience, if you remember to pay that is. If you are a colleague do not stand and talk ever, you must make sure you do the work load which used to be split between maybe 4 or 5 others because hours are constantly being cut. if you do arrive at work and realize you have left your name badge at home you had better be prepared to go home and retrieve it, even if is an hour commute on the bus on a bank holiday (which you have to work) but dont worry if you are close with management because your manager will just have a laugh with you about it and give you another, free of charge. You cannot expect to get a full weeks holiday if management don't prefer you, you must stagger it out throughout the year never exceeding 6 days at a time. Depending on your manager the rules vary to their liking. 
I would not recommend working for this company. Management are paid peanuts, and they get the job if their face fits, doesn't matter how good they are at the job, which means they do discriminate, they do favor certain colleagues and will make your life difficult if they want you to leave. 
At this job i was often finding myself reading up on laws because these guys have no idea what the laws are and do break them, constantly. when i tried to report issues to higher management they would advise you didn't raise a complaint as it would effect managements friendships. Once when a formal complaint was passed to a manager she read the form, which has to be processed and action must be taken, she took it read it and screwed it up in front of the poor colleague and threw it in the bin saying she would not go against another manager."

The colleagues, right across the board, were what made staying for so many years bearable.","Poor management. Lack of communication. Night team not included in rewards/celebrations leaving them feeling unimportant despite the fact that they work so damn hard.
Very rare to receive positive feedback, regardless of how much time and effort you'd put in... Nitpicking on the other hand seemed to come regularly.
One to one reviews just never happened. Infact, I didn't even get a leaving interview. I felt like I'd given them 6 years of my life and they hadn't even noticed I'd gone.
Would I recommend working there? No. It's OK if you're a university student just working seasonal for a bit of pocket money, but the wages are awful, (£9.65 an hour on nights), and there are very few opportunities to progress due to the fact that they've done away with most of the management now. Section leaders are paid £1 an hour more that regular colleagues but are expected to work longer hours and get a Hell of a lot of grief.
The only thing that made the whole thing bearable were the friends I made during my time there."

Had to guess my way through the majority of my paperwork for months, unacceptable considering magazine promotions required me to deal with an external company and an external moderator.

- I was a 19 year old girl, petite, being required to drag extremely heavy loads around the shop floor every day - on warehouse trolleys that were often breaking or refusing to steer

- I was the only person trained on newspapers and magazines, but I was only given three shifts a week. The other four days were ""covered"" by someone who had to do it on top of their other job and didn't know how to do it. Hundreds of papers/magazines were wasted each week, left on the shelves for days, or left unreturned to the printer. My manager always gave me the blame.

- Because I only had three shifts a week, I had to work another part-time job at another big company. I passed out cold one evening at my other workplace through tiredness and stress. Due in at Asda at 6am the next morning, I called in sick so I could rest, fearing I'd pass out again. Told Asda I'd been unable to see a doctor yet because of the timing of it, but that they could call my manager at my second job if they needed confirmation. They refused, and I was given a yellow warning - one disciplinary away from being fired. Apparently if you have worked there less than six months, you don't get the luxury of being ill.

- My manager was rarely working at the same time as me so I couldn't talk to him about my frustrations. I left him messages, which were always ignored.

- Other colleagues in my own department must have felt the same about their jobs - no one cared, everyone was grumpy and rude. Without exception.

The work is easy","Pay is now only minimum wage. 
You will have a basic contract which is normally a 8 hour weekend flex but there will be overtime however even if you were to do the same hours overtime wise week and week they are massively reluctant to contract you to it. 
Everyone is very stressed and very overworked causing moral to be through the floor due to a lack of other colleagues in terms of staffing levels and help from management. 
The management at store level is massively, massively lacking in ever sense oft the word. From lack of support to complete lack of  communication and even though they cannot accept it there is very much a 'us and them' culture.
When you have a visit from head office management (area manager and up) it becomes a comical farce because then there is pandemonium and only then  will you see the management try and take control in order to get the credit.
Praise and acknowledgment is very slow in coming if indeed you ever receive any at all.
Training used to be excellent now your just thrown on the department with a very basic idea of what to do and expected to just do it. The work is easy but not until you know what you are doing.
Colleagues are treated in general poorly. There is nothing to motivate you in general to do a good job and so a lot of people just don't. Things like breakfast of a morning have been taken away. The bonus received yearly has been massively reduced  to the point none of us even recognise it.   
They are undergoing a mass 'reinvention' in order to make them more competitive due to the struggles that have been well documented in the news. This has been handled badly and is causing untold issues for customers and colleagues alike. 
My advice to you would be to walk around the store before you join and look at staffing levels on the shop floor, the level of product on the shelves and the general happiness of the staff it will tell you a lot before you start. 
Asda is all about the customer however it is severely neglecting its colleagues and now it really isn't a good place to work and the customers are dwindling down in numbers. Improve things for colleagues and the store as a whole will improve!."

Furthermore, there is some degree of flexibility with shifts and hours worked. However, this is very dependent on the willingness of the management team - which often leaves a lot to be desired.","There are numerous. The biggest downsides in my opinion are the following:

- Atrocious management. I was never personally introduced to the store manager, and the only contact I ever get with any managers (not team leaders/section leaders) is when they decide to give me a new task that has absolutely nothing to do with my actual job, or they decide to complain about something. As the saying goes: ""Once I did wrong and that I heard ever; twice I did good but that I heard never"".
- Unfair absence policy. I called in sick once, and was explicitly warned (without ANY sympathy to the fact that I was actually very unwell on that day) that if I was to take another day off during the probationary period (12 weeks), I'd most likely lose my job.
- Zero value. I feel that no-one in the store really cares at all about me as an individual, or even as an employee. The only person in a management position (section leader) who actually cared about me was one of the youngest people there. Anyone in a senior rank than you (and even those who simply perceive themselves to be so) simply does not care. It is quite depressing frankly, knowing that you are essentially treated as a well-paid slave to the company."

I applied for a Job in groceries and was given something completely different. I felt like I was just somebody filling in a space and under valued. I was given a job that wasn't for me however I accepted it  (what did have to loose). First day of shift was awful, was introduced to section leader for 2 minutes then was told to go do my job, no training at all or heads up on anything. When I asked them general questions they didn't answer them or show any care or engagement.
The person who sorted out hiring me wasn't helpful. When I approached her to ask if their was anything else available she didn't look into it and was rude towards me. When I asked about doing a different role she said I wasn't capable of doing it (I just wanted todo something like groceries or staking shelves!, their were open jobs available) I am perfectly capible of doing that.

When I called to resign I was passed around from place to place, different people. They haven't evan paid me since I had that conversation and I doubt they will.

All its competitors pay more, some quite significantly yet ASDA continues to under perform financially - and its a downward trend. Any correlation?

Behind the cheery family facade there is low morale. To make a decent wage significantly more hours than contracted need to be worked. This is what ASDA rely on, people desperate for more hours that say yes at the expense of their work life balance. The work culture dictates that if you say no sometimes then other requests may be viewed unfavourably. Take that as you will.

Poor holiday entitlement, no opportunity for rostered weekends off. Would a shift system really be that difficult? Lots of staff on different contracts doing same job.

Our department can't afford to replace workers who left on part time contracts but apparently can afford two section leaders on full time higher pay? Then they wonder why the profits are slimming....

- Rotas changed at shorrt notice, unsocial hours. I'm lucky in that I don't need a full time wage at the moment so I can turn down ridiculous shifts demanded the night before but some colleagues are not so lucky and managers take advantage of that.

- Section leaders are useless no power to actually implement any changes or support workers but paid more for relaying management orders.

- Management is incredibly indiscrete,  very gosspiy atmosphere. Playing favourites and politics between managers and departments.

-Constant reinforcement of 'family' ethos contrasts with huge pressure for departments and stores to compete against each other.

-Middle-management only help out if there is a visit and even then only sporadically. Very uncommunicative (will only send messages through section leaders even if you have directly approached them about something) and unresponsive to shop-floor-level staff's complaints. Incredibly uncaring about chronic health issues or other problems staff may have and will discipline you rather than engage if you complain

Great Colleagues to work with.","So many recently!
Managers restructure that saw some very good and skilled managers leave but some not so skilled managers stay! The reduction in colleague's leaving stores looking unstocked with gaps in almost all aisles as we do not have enough colleagues to keep up with the work load. It's as if Head office forgets that customers are in the store and are asking colleagues where items are. They must think we just refill stock all day with nothing getting in our way. And on top of that most of our shop floor colleagues are on checkouts for most of the shift due to lack of colleagues for checkouts and queue build up. The company also makes a big fuss over area manager visits. If the store looks good it's only because the area manager is due to visit not because we want to WOW our customers. I think such visits should be out of the blue to keep stores in top condition all of the time. It's the customers we need to impress no the managers. Asda recently stopped its £20 gift card at Christmas for colleagues. This is a little thing that colleagues liked and it all helps for those who are not on full time contracts which are hard to get now. A new computer system and lack of tanning.

The job is EXHAUSTING, at least for the new comers, they give 40 deliveries a day to the new guys and 20 to the older employees, and when you carry peolpe's shopping all day up and down flats your back starts to hurt.
The shifts were two, first one starts from 7 am and the other one starts at 2 pm, i used to work 8 hours every day but many days i had so many deliveries that i worked 10 or sometimes 11 hours, and with NO BREAKS!!! i never had a single break!! i worked 5 months there and i always worked 9 hours straight with not a single break ever, not even to eat lunch, i used to eat an apple or a sandwitch while driving in between deliveries.
Some of the older drivers did have a bit of time for breaks because they had less deliveries.
I worked there over the winter, so it was always so cold, and was raining most of the days and i remember getting home at night completely soaked, even my underwear were wet from the rain...
I dont know how i lasted that long there but i had to pay the rent, and obviously in the meantime i was looking for other jobs and as soon as i found another i quit.
And on top of all this, the salary was minimun, 6.50 at the time, while other companies for the same position pay 10 or 11.

Bonus's can get convoluted and you have very little impact on how it gets calculated.

Very bad appraisal process - review yourself in a huge form and then argue with your manager over a pre-determined score that was decided months earlier at a management offsite meeting with little to no baring on the work you actually did and more on personality opinions.

Promotion process itself is pretty ludicrous and changes names and style every few years. Expect it to take 6 - 18 months when you are already doing the role to the level they want and then up your deliverables to the point where you are working 60 - 80 hours every week.

No such thing as a reasonable request or response if you decline a shift or need a day off for a reason.
Management quick to blame you and won't take anything you say as a valid point (from personal experiences) if they think your wrong then your wrong even if your not and this gets proven. Treat you differently if you've made them look silly.

Understaffing is a constant problem, as people leave, recruitment is non existent as the wages budget for each dept is squeezed more and more so there are fewer people to do the same amount of work which means corners are cut. 
Christmas is the worst time for stress. The music Asda plays over the radio is just dire and depressing especially as it's played from October. 
The whole management structure is very cliquey meaning those who are part of the inner circle get promoted first. 
Training is almost non existent especially those who are advanced to Section Leader. You could be in the job for months before you get sent for training.

Being paid the bare legal minimum, to the penny, doesn't make you feel too valued. No extra money for driving.  Considering the difference in potential consequences of messing up your job when stacking a shelf to driving a goods vehicle, that's pretty harsh.

Reversing an Iveco autobox up a steep hill is an acquired skill for sure, u get used to it though.

flexible but quite boring/time consuming as a full time endeavour unless you step up to management and deal with the rubbish thrown at you - often not worth the wage for what you're expected to do!
poor wage especially full time
hiring process is often poorly communicated
new contract base is an absolute scam, a little extra money but no flexibility! you become a slave to the company"

They have a relatively new IT director who seemed like a really nice guy, he is however hamstrung by having poisonous managers reporting to him. Often heard members of the management team say “they wouldn’t understand, they never worked in stores like us”.  

I often witnessed people actively be bullied by senior management and talked to like children, whilst using vindictive ways to make people feel uncomfortable in their role. There was always a decent level of “sickness” around the department.

Promotions and opportunities are offered to those who suck up to senior management most.

I accepted an exit interview from HR after I resigned. I spent 20 minutes explaining what I had witnessed and my experiences, to which the lady sat there and nodded and said “oh that’s not good” and didn’t document anything I said. She then asked me about anything positive I could draw from my time, I told her the very few things I noted above, she then spent the next 10 minutes writing them down and asked me if I could expand on them.

being out on the road","Right Cons :

I have worked here for coming up to 2 years this year! when I first started it was great could deliver early to customers if they are in which in turn meant I could be finished and back home nice and early !

Now though they have a 20min rule! which means I can be sat around in a layby or if I'm lucky I go home for over a hr waiting now image this you have 1hr to waste your in the middle of nowhere its 8 at night the outside temp is -5 if you leave the van idling you get scored down on your driving ! so your sat freezing so you can get your star points! ..

Next I am pretty good at this job and its an instore joke that I will be the first van back! and here lies the next problem...because I can ""bang"" them out I get shafted with the biggest run every time I go in ! 

on a sunday I am always the second to last van out .....but wait now I am the first van with the biggest drop! ...it gets better there was no loader/ no paper work printed and I was due out in 13mins so I had to do all that myself ...why was there no loader because they never cover them!

On to my next point: if you struggle at this job then you get looked after by which I mean you will get a nice 6 drop (beause your struggling) 

The vans oh boy the vans 8/10 the tyres are right on the limit the services are never done on time they are generally still filthy even after the whole WATCHDOG thing!

At the moment they are advertising the gob as 8.50 -9.55 !!!! 9.55 is night rate you will only be contract till 10 at night to get night rate on the new ""flexible contract"" you would need to be there till after 12!

No pressure to 'hard sell' or upsell - the pricing structure in the Opticians means you can comfortably provide whatever your patient needs. 
Culture of honestly and openness within the business. Mistakes and failures are treated like a learning opportunity rather than a stick to beat you with.","No/little support if needed - senior management in stores have little to no interest or experience in healthcare, and regional healthcare managers are spread over a massive area, so you'll be lucky to see them twice a year, and generally they have no healthcare experience - more interested in a 4 foot accessory bay because that's what they understand. 
Staffing levels are tight, which is understandable in a low cost business, but becomes dangerously short staffed if someone leaves or goes off sick - it can take months to get approval to recruit. 
Quality of support staff is massively variable, you're more likely to be forced to take on staff that can no longer lift and carry in a warehouse, regardless of if they are suitable and capable of working in an Opticians as it's seen as an 'easy' department. 
Hours are long. Very long. Full time is 45 hours a week, and you'll routinely need to do significantly more than that because you'll usually have to cover someone's holiday, sickness, etc. 
Only an illusion of career progression for the ambitious - annual appraisals and regular performance conversations but regional healthcare manager jobs are not advertised, they are given to well performing George or Home Shopping managers with connections, unless you want to be a supermarket manager, you can not progress, I am not aware of any Optical Managers that have been promoted in the last 4 years - maybe possible if you live near Leeds head office but I'm not aware of it happening. 
Promises of new technology, wage models, support structures, changes to policy, etc. are routinely just never mentioned again. PMS we do have is slow, buggy, crashes often and is locked down so tight it makes it difficult to do your job."

- Substantial Christmas bonus (paid late February), depending on how well the store has done over the past year (can be up to £3-400 for a full-time colleague, significantly more for managers)","- Low night pay-rates
- Low Section Leader pay-rates
- Working weekends (and often unsociable hours, shifts for day colleagues can be 6am-2pm one day and 2pm-10pm the next) is a given — to be expected in retail
- Not always flexible on holidays and changing hours — flexibility often seems only one-way, depending on your manager or section leader
- All breaks are unpaid on the new contract
- Seasonal colleagues (and indeed all colleagues) are often not treated brilliantly. If you don't ask you don't get; this is retail after all."

Good length contract. When I had to take time off for a serious illness, they were completely understanding and respectful.

Some managers are great, some are awful.

With some jobs, they will leave you to it.","They do demand too much from some colleagues, for example, sometimes they will expect one person to do jobs meant for three different ones, and do them in the time   it would take three people to do them.

The system for working stock from the back-up is flawed. Unless it is done 100% correctly, 100% of the time (which it never is), then you can end up with the back-up looking really heavy.

If you didn't sign up for the new contracts that came into force in 2017, you are paid National Living Wage, which is great for under 25s, but not so for over 25s.

I do not recommend becoming a section leader unless you are happy to be paid only an extra £1 an hour, and have essentially the same duties and work the same hours as a manager. I have known colleagues who left a section leader position, because they could not handle the pressure."

ASDA,2019-04-10, Shop Floor Assistant,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Oldham, England, England",3,4.0,1.0,,1.0,2.0,2.0,v,r,v,Was very good but gone downhill.,"- The people I've met whilst working at Asda are some of the most funniest and humble. Had some really good times along with them and I still see them from time to time. 

- Some of the perks are pretty decent if used on a consistent basis such as the 10percent discount (20percent at certain times of the year) and the Asda Perks website which gives you discount to cinema tickets and days out events etc...

- The hours are there if wanted (well the store I was in had hours due to their recruitment policies which I'll explain down in cons later).  So basically, I had a contract which was part time but from time to time I used to do full time hours with the added benefit of my holiday allowance being adjusted for the extra hours I have done.

- Even though I had a contract, section leader allowed me to be flexible in terms of my working hours. This allowed me to take care of some of my personal stuff that needed my attention. 

- There are people who have worked at Asda for years and know the colleague hand book inside out and are willing to help you out once you are in trouble. 

- I have had the pleasure of working under some of the best line managers you could ask for. They would guide and encourage you in order to be best in what you are doing. That encouragement is all that is needed in order to feel appreciated. 

Some managers have even agreed with what cons I will mention soon as they believe the shop floor workers are getting the short end of the stick such as Sunday pay.

- With it being local to me, I had literally no cost. This is an advantage for those who want the benefit of a local job. 15-20 mins walk depending if i was in zombie mode.

- Booking of annual leave is easy enough. Except for one time, all my annual leave request had been accepted. Only time you can't book annual leave is Xmas week and new years for obvious reasons.","- Pay was a bit lacking. They tried to con you with ""Paid Breaks"" when they compared themselves alongside Tesco. Also, there was a reason why most people would try and avoid working Sundays due to no extra supplement on Sunday working -  which personally I thought was a bit of a sad thing. 

- When I first started, training was decent. You budded up with someone for around a week as you get to know the store and the way Asda expects you to provide customer service. 

When I went back for my second stint, I was in a batch of people that Asda was their first job and training was non-existent. Literally, they struggled to find their feet and confidence. Don't get me wrong it's not hard working in a supermarket. However, you need the training and guidance if it is the first job you've had.

- As time went on, people left without being replaced (I understand the landscape for shopping has completely changed with the internet and the smaller stores such as Aldi picking up some of the business that Asda would've always had therefore there needs to be a limit of staff). This made existing workers pick up 2+ people worth of work which sometimes could be accomplished while other times could not be. 

Due to the expectation for you to do this by certain managers, people used to get fed up and ring up sick or go awol which made those who were already in be bogged down in more work.

- ""We listening"" survey. Each year Asda conducts this. Now in the store I worked at, rumours were flying about regarding the survey results being ""modified"". This was also confirmed in confidence by a deputy store manager, fresh trade manager and a section leader. 

I have pulled managers regarding the end results and how each year you have different ways of showing the stats and how its convenient that certain departments are being clumped together in order to get a decent score of morale etc... No one's ever replied back to me with a answer to it. 

Basically ""We listening"" survey is a CON. 

- Certain section leaders need to get a life and learn how to people manage. This job is about management of people and goods. If you don't have people then you won’t have the goods in store in order for the customers to buy.

Problem is there is a stigma with section leader’s job. Good people with good sense won't go for it as there is HARDLY any career progression. I should know as I have seen it with my own very eyes."

Body straining (requires a lot of ducking under low bars if you're tall, bending down low to reach items, putting totes on belts and a lot of walking which puts a lot of strain on your neck, back, feet, wrists, etc)

Toxic management which can bare a huge weight on your mental wellbeing where each colleague has to track down every two minutes downtime they've had off their gun/scanner onto their own notepad which result in disciplinary action and threats about losing your job if one little period of time isn't covered for."

No full-time positions for those hired within the last few years.
No possibility of career progression for non-full-time staff (most of us).
Work is gruelling compared to most other retail jobs I've worked.
As is typical for Walmart globally, the central company has no respect for workers. They are currently trying to cut everyone's pay and conditions by forcing a new contract on the workforce, who will otherwise face the sack.
Jobs that used to be consider 7/8 hour jobs are now 6 hours. Therefore, wages are effectively cut for many, and those jobs are far more strenuous than they were previously.
Some customers are extremely abusive and the management doesn't do too much about it.
Many of the managers are racist towards travelling community customers who shop there and pay for their goods like anyone else does."

Good for part timers 
There is always something to do 
Maybe the discount card for when it's double discount otherwise it doesn't make much difference.","Don't turn up to work on time as they class this as late. But also don't turn up more than 15 minutes earlier than your start time as they will not pay you those extra minutes. This may sound like those minutes do not matter but if you work an extra 15 minutes every shift for 5 days that's over an hours worth of work you've done for them for free!  You are always given unrealistic amounts of work to do in a short space of time that you'll never get done in time and to the standard your meant to do it to. This is so the manager can have ago at you for unfinished work. The managers enjoy belittling there staff and making sure other staff know how much ork you haven't done. Even if you do get all the work done they will always find more for you to do and then complain you haven't finished that!
You do not get paid for any breaks and must take your break even if you don't want to. You'll still loose your break and will not be paid for working through it. They do not like you going to the toilet while at work this must be while on your break. So if like me they make you go on your break at 12pm and then you don't get another break till 7pm that's a long time holding in a pee. If you do go to the toilet and your manager finds out they will time you and frighten to take that time off your break.
You have to work a weekend shift and it's almost impossible to get the day off unless taken as a holiday or unpaid leave.
If you stay later then 15 minutes after your shift has ended you must make sure your manager knows otherwise you wont get paid for the extra. You also have to work every bank holiday unless you book it as a holiday or as a day unpaid. You do not get paid any more for working a bank holiday this only applies at Christmas where you get paid time and half. Your not allowed to book a holiday around Christmas and may only get Christmas day off. Managers only see you as a number and not as a person as they couldn't care less if your struggling to do the work as you may have an injury etc. Don't expect to ever get full time work  unless your best friends with ""benefits"" with the manager."

Shift work is good for parents
Job itself is pretty easy, however...","1. No concern for staff welfare. Many staff are signed off sick due to stress.
2. Serious problems with security (shoplifting is rampant) 
3. Major issues in communication between departments and managers
4. Massive cutbacks to staff meaning departments are poorly stocked and staff are overwhelmed
5. Major issues with management. Poor communication. Everyone is out for themselves. Everything takes too long. Admin are a joke. 
6.No proper training!
7. Aggressive attitude to sick days and time off

Honestly, Asda is a horrific place to work. I'm leaving as soon as I can get another job.  I've never worked anywhere so disorganised. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm so stressed out all the time. There is no concern for staff welfare. Staff are routinely harassed and verbally assaulted, even harassed by customers on social media. Management do not care. Only look at numbers and figures. Senior staff members undermine section leaders all the time. 

Too many staff leaving and not being replaced. Shoplifters are never prosecuted so they return all the time. No one really cares anymore about Asda, we all just do the bare minimum. Also, too much staff theft going on without repercussions (no police action. If you're caught stealing, the police should get involved. But no, not at Asda! You'll just be asked if you'd like to resign instead)  

Don't work at Asda. JUST DON'T!"

Your work isn't really affected my the amount of customers i.e. when you work in fast food there's rush hours however when you're stocking shelves whether or not your busy the pace of work is the same","Can at times in particular departments such as home shopping feel a bit monotonous and boring

You will have to deal with lots of rude customers even if your not working tills. Apparently to customers you are invisible so expect to have customers drive trolleys into you or not move out of the way when you're dragging a 6ft tall pallet of microwaves or beer.

Also expect annoying questions from customers e.g. on a Sunday you will have at least 5 customers ask you if the shop closes early and when you tell them yes they will get angry and claim the sign outside the store says 24/7 even though Sunday trading laws have been in this country for decades.

Good people (employees) to work with, good benefits; Sharesave, Pension, staff discount doubled occasionally throughout the year.","Following enforcement of the new contract 6 in November 2019, Asda have now enforced a change to the job spec. Delivery drivers are now expected to load own vans - a job previously done very well and efficiently by experienced Service Crew. This is practically doubling the workload in one fell swoop. It's a physically demanding role without this. Failure to agree to the change will result in breach of contract apparently, and could lead to dismissal if you also refuse to accept another store role. Contract 6 has been dubbed the 'Martini' contract - Anytime, any place, anywhere - (70's tv ad apparently!) which means you'll be moved when it suits them. 
Google ""Asda workers"".
If you're looking to drive for Asda and are prepared to do the physical loading on top of the actual delivery role then fine, it's just the enforcing of change on existing employees that is wrong.
Holiday requests are turned down more often than you would imagine leading to resentment and unauthorized absences.

Horrible section leaders that never face the consequences of bullying and making their staff feel alienated, even if they verbally assault you in front of customers on the shop floor during busy hours. For a company that is all about happy customers and keeping happy staff, that is a joke!
Very sneaky gossipy staff that start rumours and are too interested in their nights out, taking things not prescribed if you know what I mean, and telling of their drunken stories and arranging the next outing
One rule for one and not for all
Contracted to finish work at 10pm and come in the next morning for 7am, 8am, or 9am
Refusing to increase contract hours or employ full time to current or new colleagues

Management dont back you up when you have issues with customers or staff
Certain staff are allowed to be on their mobiles on the shop floor, eat, waste time talking with personal friends, ""run errands"" for section leaders or runners
The same staff show up late or take longer breaks than they are entitled, which delays breaks for everyone else
Even after your employment if you need anything from asda for references, mortgages, proof of employment, tax rebates and tax codes etc good luck getting what you need in a timely matter, all you get told is ""5-7 working days"" or ""your case is assigned to a colleague"" when the query can be dealt with in seconds leaving an unnecessary wait 
When time off is needed for home matters or personal issues you are advised to ""go seasonal"" or ""use all your holiday allowance for the year"" rather than be supported

You don't really need to think about much, if you can read and understand how numbers work there is little on the shop floor to challenge you.

In my store at least, most of the staff were friendly, and look out for each other. Most managers are also completely reasonable: they understand that they have to work with their subordinates and cannot rule by fear. Plenty of jokes and laughs when appropriate, genuinely a big family culture","Dealing with moronic co-workers, however this is usually short lived. As stated above, most people are nice enough, but the turnover rate of new staff is incredibly high primarily due to their own stupidity: theft, turning in drunk, late, not at all, lying about things that can very easily be checked. The potential pitfall here is that if a manager or established member of staff takes a dislike to you early on it can spell the end- though if you are there long enough and make an acceptable impression you are likely in a job for as long as you want it.

The new contract is definitely worse than the one I was on, but the provisions in it seemingly were not exploited by management whilst I was there - although I never signed. This is part of a larger trend of reduced benefits which began before my time- one long standing coworker had stock in Walmart worth a substantial amount, which was gifted to them upon completing their probationary period!"

Sub-inflation annual pay increments for achieving KRA targets (KPIs), 
Home office colleague bonus tied exclusively to total business results rather than individual performance, 
Disparate rates of progression (and promotional requirements/expectations) between internal teams/functions, 
Preach transparency but rarely practice it, 
Appraisal process focuses on ""behaviours"" at the expense of actual results (heavily weighted toward ""perception"", with little or no benchmarking between teams either in-function or within the wider business, very much a case of ""if-your-face-fits"" you'll do well and progress faster irrespective of your capability to deliver measurable results),

* Can pick up multiple skills by bouncing
 around each department","* Very fast paced work. Expectations set but the head office (that never visit) are unrealistic and unreachable without cheating the system. We are always behind on picks. I have been told off and had two meeting for working according to all the store policies. Considering that previous employers all said I’m hard working and this is the only one telling me that I’m too slow says a lot.

Managers are only trained once upon promotion and that’s it. You can’t introduce new ideas for operation (on a considerable scale) as it has to come from the higher ups (that I have never seen). 

No customer limit during COVID. Store has been way too packed (with queues passing the aisles) since the government removed their strict limit. Impossible to social distance and work. Customer are right beside at almost all times.

No cheap staff food. They removed the catering service and wasted money refurbishing the break room (hid all evidence that we used to have a catering service. 

Expected to work like robots. You get I trouble for speaking to colleagues, especially if they see you laughing. Talcom guns go missing all the time because colleges don’t trust each other to put them back when they are done. If it wasn’t for the terrible music playing on the radio, you wouldn’t hear a whisper during the night shift because people don’t talk to each other on the shop floor.

Word of advice is to avoid at all costs. If you are stuck for choices and have to earn money then try and earn as much experience in each department and get trained on all the equipment. This will boost your resume for when you eventually leave."
